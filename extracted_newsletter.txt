;2023–2024 NBA awards: It keeps getting tougher - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By JOSH FELTON                                                     | April 23, 2024
With the NBA regular season ending last week, it’s time to make my annual award selections. This year, the NBA made award selections positionless, which in theory should make it easier for voters to make a decision. But does it? Does this put guards at a disadvantage to earn the most prestigious defensive awards? How does the minimum games requirement help or hurt the cases of deserving candidates who decided to play through injury to meet the threshold? Here are my selections. Rookie of the Year: Victor Wembanyama (San Antonio Spurs) This might be the easiest selection of all. Wembanyama is having one of the greatest rookie seasons we’ve ever seen. He became the first rookie to score 1,500 points, block at least 250 shots and hit 100 3-point shots in a single season. His 21.4 points per game and 10.6 rebounds is the highest for a rookie in over

With just under a week remaining in the regular season, the time has come to make selections for the league’s most prestigious awards. Last year, I gave my opinion on those who were the most deserving candidates for each award, noting that it was one of the toughest decisions I’ve ever had to make. This year has been even more difficult as I anticipate many more deserving candidates being snubbed for these awards. Because of this, I've decided to change the criteria. In years past, team success has played a huge part in these awards; however, for this exercise, I will be selecting strictly the best players for each award. “Best” will denote how much a player’s production and skillset helps a random team win a championship. The only outside factor influencing my decisions will be games played. This will isolate a player’s overall impact from that of their team’s

The 2021-2022 NBA Season has officially come to an end, and for the first time in years the basketball community is in disaccord. In the past two years, the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award and the Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY) were pretty straightforward for most fans, reporters and voters alike. This season, however, the parity is at an all-time high. Multiple people have a legitimate claim to virtually every single award, and the playoffs are almost certain to be legendary. In what was easily the toughest awards ballot I’ve had to complete, here are my selections for each award. Rookie of the Year: Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons) Cunningham has been one of the most exciting players — not just rookies, but players — to watch this season. His versatility on the offense and his phenomenal vision make him one of the most promising young players in the league

The 2024 NFL draft is just around the corner, and with that comes a massive amount of predictions and projections — a lot of which will likely turn out incorrect. With this in mind, I will go through a few of my favorite landing spots for some of the top players in this draft class and discuss just how I think they can be implemented in order to flourish at the next level. 1. Pick 9 Chicago Bears: Rome Odunze WR, University of Washington The Bears have found themselves in an incredible position going into this year’s draft — holding two top-ten picks (including the first overall pick) in what is projected to be one of the most loaded drafts in years. After trading Justin Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers, their first pick should already be made with Caleb Williams, the quarterback that is seen to be the best prospect

With the NFL Draft beginning this Thursday, we have one last opportunity to look at the possibilities that could unfold and to delve into a bit of the chaos. A lot of these teams have already been “locked in” to take certain players; however, if previous drafts are anything to go by, there will most certainly be some crazy moves that occur, so it’s best to take these mock drafts merely as a thought experiment rather than gospel. I’ll be giving some of my thoughts on the first 15 picks and then going through what I believe will transpire throughout the rest of the first round. Pick 1: Chicago Bears (traded from Carolina Panthers): Caleb Williams QB, University of Southern California There’s not much that needs to be said about Williams other than the fact that he has been penciled in for this pick for nearly two years now.

Let’s set the scene: the sun begins shining a bit brighter each day, and the temperature climbs to a nice 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Sidewalks are no longer riddled with ice, and the once bare trees are now covered with lush green leaves. As cities awaken from their winter slumbers, so do runners. The longer daylight hours invite runners to lace up their shoes and find rhythm in their feet once again. I, among other runners, like to line up the spring season with a selection of road races. This spring’s highlight takes a zoom into the Cherry Blossom 10-Miler, a beloved race that draws elite fields right into the heart of Washington, D.C. And so, every year at the peak of the cherry blossom bloom, runners of all kinds awaken from their hibernation to rediscover a vibrant running community gathered near the Washington Monument at a chilly 6:30 a.m. Big

The internet serves as a haven of scientific information, representing an era where the knowledge of anything we wish to know is available at our fingertips. Yet in many ways, accurate, firsthand accessibility to scientific research and comprehensibility of scientific knowledge is severely limited. A substantial overhaul is needed in the way that the general populace accesses scientific knowledge. A key part of the problem is that a significant portion of scientific literature, including journals and press releases, is hidden behind steep paywalls. The cost to access these articles can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars, a price that is unaffordable for most individuals. This practice not only limits the dissemination of knowledge but also hampers the public's trust in science. For many university students, researchers and labs, larger institutions — such as universities and research centers — often bear the cost of these subscriptions, which mitigates part of

I’m sitting here writing my last piece for my column in The News-Letter, and I am at a loss for words. I’ve thought about this moment for a while: what I’d write in my last piece, where in my life I’d be and what closing words I’d share. While the last four years have shaped who I am and influenced who I have become, I’ve come to the realization that, at my core, I’m the same I’ve always been: discovering myself through my writing and growing from my experiences. I look back at this photo above: it’s of me sitting on Arpoador Rock in Rio de Janeiro, a place I’ve been coming to see the sunset with my family for ages. However, this past spring break, instead of coming to Rio with my family, I was here with friends from college. I was really excited for the trip, but also

Upon entering, the earthy green atmosphere and ornaments of succulents throughout the shop create a welcoming and hospitable environment for customers. Soft but lively music plays in the background, complementing the servers grazing from table to table handing out orders and creating a bustling and cheery environment. The cafe itself is an adorable study spot, with ample lighting and seats in the back for students to pull out their laptops and notebooks. In fact, the cafe was filled with people doing work, and I easily imagined myself coming back to enjoy a coffee while studying.

After establishing an early 3–0 lead, courtesy of graduate students Garrett Degnon and Jacob Angelus, the Blue Jays were able to hold Maryland to their lowest goal total since March 2017. With this result, Hopkins is the top seed in the Big Ten Tournament and will face the winner of the quarter final game between University of Michigan and Ohio State University.

American psychologists had come to do mindfulness therapy with them, supposedly to help them cope with the day-to-day difficulties of living under a military occupation. These were well-meaning psychologists who wanted to use their toolkit to provide assistance, but many Palestinians saw that as a depoliticizing act. They were worried that it would distract from larger political and social questions.

The University’s Board of Trustees voted to divest its endowment from thermal coal on Friday. The vote, which was announced in a statement on Tuesday, comes almost three months after the Public Interest Investment Advisory Committee (PIIAC) recommended that the University divest from fossil fuels. PIIAC is a group of 13 undergraduates, graduate students, faculty and staff from across the University’s divisions. The recommendations were released in September following six years of campaigning from Refuel Our Future (Refuel), a student organization that has called for the University to divest from fossil fuels. Refuel hoped that the University would follow PIIAC’s recommendations to “terminate all direct investments” from Carbon Underground 200 companies (CU 200). These companies are considered leaders in the fossil fuel industry and include fossil fuels aside from coal such as oil and natural gas. Senior Atlas Elawad, the current president of Refuel, said that the Board’s decision came

In June 1976, roughly 10,000 students in Soweto, South Africa organized a peaceful protest against new legislation decreeing that Afrikaans, alongside English, be used in Soweto high schools. Afrikaans was known as the “language of the oppressor” in apartheid South Africa. Upon their peaceful march toward Orlando Stadium, the protesters were met with heavily armed police. What started off as a tear gas attack eventually turned into firing rounds of live ammunition. Hundreds of people are believed to have died and images of this police brutality spread internationally, sparking a firmer liberation movement by international forces against apartheid. Beginning in the 1970s, a student-led grassroots movement in the U.S. demanded that universities divest their holdings in South Africa. The campaign’s objective was to damage the South African economy so that the government would acquiesce to the demands of anti-Apartheid protesters nationally and internationally. Universities are often one target of divestment,

The Hopkins Board of Trustee notes are only available 25 years after they are written; therefore, only records before 1991 are available. From 1985 until 1987, Hopkins undergraduates, graduate students and a few faculty protested the University’s investment in apartheid South Africa by erecting mock shanty towns around campus under “the Coalition for a Free South Africa.” Only in the past few years have the Board of Trustees’ notes become public. They illuminate how the Board responded to student protest as well as how they reckoned with the morality of investing in a violent, white supremacist separatist state. They serve as valuable lessons for any current student activists. The Board of Trustees is charged with “exercising fiduciary responsibility for advancing Johns Hopkins’ mission and goals in a sustainable manner, through wise stewardship of all of its resources for the common good and for generations to come.” From reading the 1980s

BookTok: Trends and community - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

During and following the pandemic, reading has been on the rise. This has been evident among online communities, like and including TikTok’s “BookTok.” There, readers share book reviews, talk about their reading habits and recommend books to other TikTok users. Since then, BookTok has brought a very specific brand of reading to the forefront of mainstream pop culture. While reading had never been fully removed from pop culture, the additional leisure time people experienced while quarantining in their homes in 2020 required them to (re)discover ways to pass the time; many young people rediscovered a love of reading that stuck with them, even after life returned to normal. In particular, young women have benefited from the community cultivated by BookTok. Broadly, people who may have previously viewed reading as a solitary activity were newly able to connect with other readers over their shared interest in literature. Beyond providing an online

The global political order is seeing an unprecedented level of conflict with the United States being a key actor in most of them. If you think of most prominent conflicts or humanitarian crises going on today, our country, for better or for worse, has played a role. Given the current tumultuous nature of U.S. policy, both foreign and domestic, understanding why and how these policies came about is crucial and a key factor in this year’s upcoming elections. Foreign policy has been at the forefront of American politicians’ platforms since the birth of the U.S. In his farewell address, George Washington argued in favor of as little political connection as possible with foreign nations. Despite Washington’s intentions however, the 18th and 19th centuries were marked by heavy violence between the U.S. and other nations as the country focused on expansionist foreign policy and commerce. In the decades that followed, America

National and regional elections are taking place in more than 50 countries around the world in 2024, including 7 of the 10 most populous countries. The presidential and legislative elections put to test human rights, economies, international relations, and prospects for peace in at least 64 countries. Among these, the spotlight is placed on five nations standing at critical crossroads: Taiwan, facing an existential threat from Beijing; the United States, navigating a divided nation; Russia, under the unrelenting grip of Putin; and India and Pakistan, enduring democratic hurdles amid regional pressures. The U.S. presidential election A rematch between President Joe Biden and Former President Donald Trump is imminent. While the matchup is a repeat of the 2020 presidential election, Trump’s court cases complicate his candidacy. Although the U.S. Constitution allows Trump to run even if he is convicted, his conviction might affect his election campaigns. Biden’s stance on the Israel-Hamas

The last year and a half seems like a blur. I couldn’t keep up with life. My homesickness reached its peak and the pressures of graduate school crushed me — I was struggling to find a way to fit into this world. My struggles with fitting into my community started in childhood. As an Indian girl, I grew up surrounded by outstandingly successful role models. These were people that have all achieved the unconventional, and I was taught that I should follow their path, so I knew a lot was expected from me by others. The culture I grew up in sometimes made me feel as though I could only satisfy those around me, especially my family, if I met their standards and fulfilled their expectations. Even when I became an adult, I carried the traces of this treatment. Hundreds of questions would hammer my brain constantly. Am I good

The exhibition "Revolution in Our Lifetime": The Black Panther Party and Political Organizing in Baltimore, 1968–1973, was unveiled at The Peale, Baltimore’s Community Museum, on Friday, April 12. The exhibit will be available until May 26. Curated by Hopkins and Morgan State University students, the exhibit features many primary sources, including never-before-seen material that provides insights into the Black Panther Party's Baltimore Chapter and political organizing during the period. In an email to The News-Letter, Professor Victoria Harms, one of two Hopkins faculty members involved with the project along with Professor Stuart Schrader, shared the success of the opening panel. "Over 100 people attended the roundtable conversation, and a record-setting total of almost 200 saw the exhibition on the first night! We were deeply impressed by the tremendous interest in our research findings and the history of the Black Panthers in the city," she wrote. As a collaborative effort, the

As the semester begins to slow down, scientific discovery has not. This week’s science news in review explores new findings from the James Webb Space Telescope, the discovery of a nitrogen-fixing organelle, an accident in molecular evolution and the legacy of Peter Higgs. Gamma-ray burst mystery: Supernova challenges expectations In October 2022, the most powerful energetic gamma-ray burst ever recorded struck Earth. The flash, referred to as the “brightest of all time” (BOAT), radiated gamma rays ten times more powerful than anything we have seen before. Existing knowledge predicted that the origin of the BOAT was a supernova called a collapsar. It is believed that collapsars can create the extreme conditions needed to produce heavy metals through nuclear fusion. However, a recent study observed nothing. No heavy elements were observed in the aftermath of BOAT. Other studies have confirmed these findings with astronomers failing to produce evidence of heavy element

Although the semester is wrapping up at Hopkins, science endeavors around the world continue to yield exciting discoveries. This week’s Science News in Review covers new technology to identify the origin of metastatic cancers, the long-term effects of pregnancy complications, novel neural circuitry for food motivation and appreciation for a butterfly in the Amazon. AI can detect the origin of metastatic cancers Metastasis occurs when cancer cells originating from one site in the body spread to other locations. Up to 5% of metastatic tumors’ origins cannot be identified. One traditional approach to identifying the origin of metastatic cancer relies on imaging fluid samples that contain cancerous cells. By identifying the characteristic morphology of specific cancer cells in fluid samples, pathologists can infer where the tumor cells originated. However, this technique still fails to pinpoint the cancer origin in some patients. Motivated by these cases, researchers from China developed a deep-learning

Six months ago, Stanford University Professor Robert M. Sapolsky wrote a book titled Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will, which argues that humans do not have free will. He calls for people to “stop attributing stuff to us that isn’t here.” He also critiques any system in which we punish or reward people because people have no control over their actions. Sapolsky’s thesis is that free will is a myth and, the sooner we accept that, the more just society will be. However, in reality, the science does not debunk but instead supports the existence of free will. For most of human civilization, philosophers have posited the existence of free will. This sentiment has driven many groups to incorporate free will as a central tenet of their ideology. For example, Christians’ belief in free will has helped them reconcile God’s all-powerful, all-good existence with the presence of worldly

On Wednesday, March 27, Sheridan Dean of University Libraries, Archives, and Museums Elisabeth M. Long hosted a virtual town hall discussion on the current status of the Milton S. Eisenhower Library (MSE) renovation project, providing notable updates on the planning process. In an interview with The News-Letter, Lauren Knudson, a freshman majoring in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, discussed her perspective on the current state of the library. “I use the library a lot, probably 20 hours a week. I think there should be more speaking levels since the current spaces often get pretty crowded,” she said. “It would also be nice if there were more natural lighting rather than feeling like you are in a dungeon.” This year marks the 60th anniversary of the library's opening in 1964. Other than a minor renovation in the 1990s, the building has stayed much the same. The motivations behind the renovation include issues

The Milton S. Eisenhower Library (MSE), a staple of the Homewood Campus, has a rich and complex history. During the 1940s, the University faced a lack of space as Gilman Hall and other buildings on campus could not accommodate the growing number of texts in their archives. In 1947, former librarian Homer Halvorson noted that Hopkins would need to begin planning a new facility. However, construction took several decades to begin. It wasn’t until 1958 that the University began a 10-year, $76 million funding drive, according to the Baltimore News-Post. Specifically, a new library was listed as one of the primary needs for the campus. Later that year, it was decided that the new library would be built at the front of Keyser Quad, and preliminary construction began in June 1962. The architecture of the library followed the Georgian motifs of nearby buildings, with red brick and white trim. Former

Milton S. Eisenhower (MSE) Library is slated for a complete renovation beginning in summer 2024. As the University’s principal research library since 1964, MSE has only had minor updates over the years. The MSE Modernization Project, which will encompass the approximately 182,000-square-foot library, will have an estimated cost of $100 million and is expected to take two and a half years. Its renovation will impact more than 26,000 students and 7,500 faculty across nine divisions. The project will also generate jobs for the Baltimore community. In particular, the HopkinsLocal program commits to contract to the project at least 20% minority or women-owned business enterprises and 13% local business enterprises. According to the FAQ section of the project’s website, there are plans for the general public outside of the Hopkins community to have access to the revamped library in an effort to increase interaction between the University and the local community.

We, Johns Hopkins student organizations advocating for reproductive justice, condemn the University’s choice of Mitt Romney as the 2024 commencement speaker. In particular, we are calling attention to Senator Romney’s damaging views on reproductive health which disproportionately affect marginalized communities. Romney voiced support for the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that overturned the constitutional right to abortion. He has maintained this anti-abortion position since 2011, when he declared that “[he] support[s] the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine.” Abortion is healthcare. In the years since Roe was overturned, we’ve seen devastating effects. In a national survey of obstetricians and gynecologists, nearly seven out of ten providers have reported that the ruling limited their ability to manage pregnancy-related emergencies. The Dobbs decision deepened health inequities, exacerbating existing racial maternal mortality crises: Black and brown people who give birth are

On Wednesday, March 27, the University announced that Mitt Romney, a U.S. Senator from Utah, will give the commencement speech for the Class of 2024 on May 23. Romney was sworn in as a senator for Utah in 2019. Previously, he served as the governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. Romney has run for the Republican presidential nomination twice and was selected as the presidential nominee in 2012. According to the Hub, Romney will receive an honorary doctor of humane letters degree in the commencement ceremony. In the article, University President Ronald J. Daniels explained that Hopkins chose Romney as the speaker because of his commitment to improving the lives of Americans and maintaining moderate political ideologies.

Is this something you could ever even imagine without seeing it first? These were the thoughts running through my head as I sat, dazzled, in the audience of the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA)’s 30th Annual Benefit Fashion Show. This year’s theme was “Upturn” and was meant to call “upon the artist, and therefore the audience, to question their relationship with society — and ultimately, with themselves.” This is not easy, nor is it comfortable. While certainly provocative, the designs I saw did not exclude comfort or ease. In fact, the show began on a particularly wholesome note.

Every college student chases after this arbitrary thing called freedom. To some, it means to study whatever they want. To others, it means to say “screw it” and go to Coachella in the middle of the semester. But for me, it looks more like what Chris McCandless did in Into the Wild — to buy a beat-up car after college, sell everything else he owns and vanish into a long road trip into the wilderness. Well (SPOILER ALERT), maybe minus the dying in Alaska part. I haven’t graduated yet and don’t have enough money for a car, nor do I have the courage like McCandless did. I did, however, have a badminton tournament in Boston and needed to drive the team up to the venue. 300 miles on I-95 along industrial New Jersey doesn’t quite compare to a tour of the American Wild West but, at this time of my

After a year and a half of logging onto Zoom meetings, most of us had our first in-person class last week. With students lounging on the Beach, studying at Brody and indulging in the grilled cheese at the FFC, it’s clear: we have achieved some sense of pre-Pandemic normalcy. Is this a good thing? Before the pandemic, most Hopkins students concentrated almost exclusively on excelling in their academics and maintaining a rigorous course load, often at the expense of their own mental health. The University itself released data in 2018 in which the majority of students described feeling overwhelmed and depressed at school. Hopkins is notorious for being a challenging school with demanding courses and overachieving students, but is this reputation sustainable? Do we really want to come back to the campus culture we left in 2020? Being sent home forced us all to take time for ourselves and reevaluate

Nine months after its draft recommendations were released, the Task Force on Student Mental Health and Well-being published its final report on Thursday detailing specific ways that the University can improve mental health on campus. The Task Force was composed of students, faculty and staff from all nine divisions. The report recommends that the University promote a climate of support, increase student access to mental health services and provide mental health awareness training to students, faculty and staff. In addition to its recommendations, the report includes information about University mental health services as well as data from the 2016 Enrolled Student Survey. Out of the 16,014 students who received a survey, 14.1 percent responded. The data compares mental health at Hopkins with that of peer institutions.

We are grateful to pursue our higher education in Baltimore, at one of the nation’s top institutions. And yet, as finals approach, and Brody remains full, many of us are burnt out.

In an email to Hopkins affiliates Wednesday morning, University leaders announced a two-day suspension of in-person classes and activities on the Homewood Campus after a spike in COVID-19 cases on Monday. The preliminary investigation revealed that the cluster was tied to an off-campus social gathering over the weekend. “We are taking a quick and proactive approach to this moment, although our numbers are small relative to our total population, out of an abundance of caution and to provide the opportunity to reinforce our communications with undergraduates about COVID safety precautions,” the administrators wrote. “Those who tested positive and live in our residence halls have been transferred to isolation housing, and others are isolating in place off campus.” There were 38 new positive student cases from 1,133 tests on Tuesday, which was the first testing day after the weekend since testing operations were suspended on Monday due to inclement weather.

Following a four-month investigation by the Office of the Dean of Student Life, the University has issued a two-year suspension to the Alpha Delta Phi (WAWA) fraternity. Though the fraternity could have applied for automatic re-recognition after the suspension lifted, Alpha Delta Phi chose instead to revoke their recognition at the University and with their national office. Vice Provost for Student Affairs Kevin Shollenberger announced the suspension in a campus-wide email on Thursday. “Alpha Delta Phi is no longer a recognized student organization, even if operating under a different name,” he wrote. “All members of our student community should be aware that any activities of an organization, ‘underground’ or otherwise, that violate university policies and/or the Student Conduct Code could result in misconduct charges against individual students.” The Office of the Dean of Student Life had been investigating the fraternity for allegations of assault, hazing and violations of its cease

The United States is entering a new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, with cases surging across the country. The seven-day moving average of new cases is at its third peak since the beginning of the pandemic. More than 83,000 new cases were added Friday and Saturday, marking the two highest numbers of new cases added in a single day. Experts warn that daily cases could soon be at six digits with fall holidays approaching and the weather getting colder, forcing people to be indoors. COVID-19 cases are also increasing in Maryland but have yet to hit the record seven-day moving average of 1,090 cases set in early May. Balancing safe socialization practices with academic work and mental health have presented challenges for students living off-campus in Baltimore. For Natalie Wu, a first-year student at the School of Advanced International Studies, staying safe from COVID-19 means adhering to guidelines from the

Editor’s Note: This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available. University President Ronald J. Daniels announced in an email to the Hopkins community that all undergraduate classes will be offered online for the entire fall semester. Ongoing on-campus research will resume in accordance to Phase 1 guidelines. Additionally, the University will also reduce tuition by 10 percent, and most incoming freshmen will not be able to live on campus. “Based on extensive consultations with our faculty experts in public health and medicine, and emerging guidance from public health officials, we have concluded that returning in person would pose unacceptable risks for you, our faculty and staff, and our neighbors in Baltimore,“ Daniels wrote. The decision was made out of a public health concern, as the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is getting worse in Baltimore and across the U.S. Additionally, 30 percent of undergraduate students would

Amid the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, University President Ronald J. Daniels announced in an email to the student body on March 10 that as of March 11, Hopkins is canceling in-person classes through at least April 12. Following spring break, the University will transition to remote instruction for all undergraduate courses. “At this time, we are aware that we have members of our community who are in the process of being tested for COVID-19, including several students who may have had exposure. With this in mind, as well as advice from public health experts regarding community transmission, limited availability of testing, and the need to shift from containment to mitigation strategies, we have decided to adopt the following immediate changes to our policies and academic programming,” Daniels wrote. In a later email, Dean of the Krieger School of Arts & Sciences (KSAS) Beverly Wendland clarified that all exams are suspended

Amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the University announced on Wednesday that it is assessing the placement of study abroad students worldwide. In an interview with The News-Letter, junior Siena DeMatteo, who was studying in Bologna, recalled learning that she would have to return to the U.S. “On Sunday the 23, my classes were canceled for the week and from there, little by little, the situation worsened,” she said. “It felt inevitable, but the fact that I had gotten confirmation just before going to sleep that Friday night that my program was still on and then waking up to that news Saturday morning was definitely a shock. But at the end of the day, I knew it was going to come to this.” According to the Hub, seven undergraduates studying abroad in Italy have returned or are returning soon to the U.S. The decision to suspend these programs came after Italy

University President Ronald J. Daniels and fellow administrators announced in an email to the Hopkins community that the University will be resuming in-person activities in the fall. These plans are not yet final, as the University is seeking additional input. The email stressed that plans for the upcoming semester are prone to change if the public health situation demands it. However, administrators hope to reach a finalized approach for returning to campus by mid-July. Rising sophomore Lubna Azmi, a first-generation/limited income (FLI) student, explained that she is hesitant about the plans in the email, which was sent on June 30. “The best decision would be to keep quarantining but no one in America is getting that,” she wrote in an email to The News-Letter. “Everyone is restless to get back to how things were... when at this point, we need new plans because people are going to die.” The statement

When University President Ronald J. Daniels announced that the semester would be entirely remote in his August 6 email, he noted that tuition would be reduced by 10 percent and that the Office of Financial Aid was allocating $15 million in additional assistance money. Heading into the fall semester, students who requested additional aid are ultimately pleased with their grants, but feel that they lacked support throughout the process. In an email to The News-Letter, Assistant Vice Provost for Financial Aid and Director of Student Financial Services Tom McDermott noted that the Office of Financial Aid is now expecting to give out $18 million in additional aid as a result of the pandemic. According to him, $4 million went towards eliminating the expectation of summer savings, a projection of $11 million for appeals and another $3 million for students who are unable to secure work-study jobs because of the pandemic.

Provost Sunil Kumar and Vice Provost for Student Affairs Alanna Shanahan announced in an email to the student body on Oct. 1 that the University will have a plan for the spring semester by Thanksgiving at the latest. They also noted that all intersession classes will be held virtually. “We have important and difficult decisions ahead of us as we look to the spring semester, and right now we can tell you how we are approaching them, if not where we will ultimately land,” they wrote. If Hopkins opens for the spring semester, all in-person activities will be optional for students and faculty, and no student will be required to physically be on campus. Most courses will continue to be offered remotely for students. The University is also considering changing the schedule for spring, such as starting the term later or cancelling spring break.

University President Ronald J. Daniels and other administrators announced in an email to University affiliates on Monday that Hopkins will offer in-person classes, research activities and housing in the spring semester. “Our plans are shaped by your tremendous efforts to date to carry out our education, research and clinical missions safely, as well as the guidance of public health experts at Johns Hopkins and nationally and the best practices of those peer institutions that have successfully returned to campus this fall,” they wrote. “They rest on continued strict adherence to public health guidelines, significant de-densification of our facilities and a widening of our testing program and requirements.” Daniels noted that the University will make a final determination on whether to carry out the plans in January based on various public health metrics. Starting in January, free weekly asymptomatic tests will be available to all affiliates. Undergraduate students living in both

By the time University announced its decision on August 6 to conduct the fall semester fully online, many students had already signed their leases and made plans to return to campus. While some scrambled to sublet their apartments and cancel their travel arrangements, others decided to return to Baltimore despite the University urging students to stay home. The decision to cancel all in-person activities for the fall semester came over a month after the University’s initial hybrid plan. As explained in an email on June 30, the University intended to have some classes in person, with others fully online. Traditional on-campus housing would be guaranteed for freshmen, while sophomores could choose to live in University-run hotels or secure their own housing. Juniors and seniors, who traditionally live off-campus, would continue to do so. The University explained that no student had to return to Baltimore in order to complete their academic

The University announced on Sept. 24 that all affiliates spending time on campus will be required to get a flu vaccination by Nov. 20. The policy applies to all students participating in on-campus activities, as well as University employees and non-employees working in University properties or leased facilities. Hopkins will be providing vaccinations free-of-charge to students in the United States, regardless of whether they are engaging in on-campus activities. Junior Izzy Geada, who is living off-campus in Baltimore, stated that she was glad the University was taking these precautions. “Frankly, it’s a relief. It’s pretty comforting that we don’t have to worry about the flu as well as corona,” she said. “At least one thing will be handled.” However, Geada also noted that the University still does not provide asymptomatic coronavirus (COVID-19) testing for students living off-campus, which she argued should be a priority.

University President Ronald J. Daniels and other administrators announced in an email to University affiliates today that Hopkins will open for increased in-person activities for Homewood undergraduates in the spring semester. Hopkins will enter Phase Two of reopening, as laid out in a draft plan released three weeks ago. All undergraduate students will be required to be tested for COVID-19 twice a week beginning Jan. 11 and to use the Prodensity app daily before coming to campus. Face coverings must be worn at all times, and students are instructed to avoid large gatherings. The Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and Whiting School of Engineering will offer 18% of their undergraduate courses in-person. Those classes will start online at the beginning of the semester but switch to in-person instruction on Feb. 2. Graduate schools and the Peabody Institute will communicate their respective plans for the spring, which may vary. No

The Prodensity app was designed through a collaboration between the Johns Hopkins Technology Innovation Center (TIC); Geraldine Seydoux, the vice dean for basic research at the School of Medicine; and George Economas, the executive director of security for Hopkins Medical Institutions. The app originally began as a way for labs to keep track of who was using their facilities and when. It has recently expanded to include daily health checks and communication tools. Development of the app began in mid-April, after all on-campus activities and research were limited to essential activities due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. During that time, many of the labs at the School of Medicine realized that they had no method to keep track of who should be let into facilities, creating a logistical nightmare for many researchers and principal investigators (PIs). When it became clear that the School of Medicine would allow for some increased

Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott announced new restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the city earlier today. Both indoor and outdoor dining will be prohibited. Outdoor gatherings in public and private facilities will be limited to 25 people, while all indoor gatherings will be capped at 10 people. Religious and retail facilities, gyms, museums and casinos will be open for 25% of maximum occupancy. The restrictions will go into effect at 5 p.m. on Friday, Dec. 11. Restaurants will be able to continue offering carry-out, delivery and drive-through service. In a press conference announcing the restrictions, Scott addressed the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Maryland reported 2,632 new cases on Tuesday, and 50 deaths were related to the virus, the highest daily number of deaths reported during the pandemic. “This is about saving lives — nothing more and nothing less,” Scott said. “COVID doesn’t get tired, COVID doesn’t take

On September 1, Governor Larry Hogan announced that Maryland will enter stage three of the state’s Roadmap to Recovery Plan beginning on Friday at 5 p.m. Local leaders, however, are left to determine whether to move forward with lifting restrictions. All businesses and manufacturing services in Maryland will be allowed to reopen. Religious facilities, retail businesses and malls can reopen at 75 percent capacity. Indoor recreation areas, restaurants and theaters can reopen but at a 50 percent capacity or a maximum of 100 people. Despite Hogan’s announcement, Baltimore City Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young announced a day later that the city will remain in the first stage of the state’s reopening plan. “While some parts of the state may feel ready to move into phase three, that is not the case for Baltimore City.

Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young announced on June 19 that Baltimore will enter stage two of reopening following shutdowns to prevent the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). This measure follows the state-wide safer-at-home advisory and city-wide decision to allow outdoor dining and limited reopening of non-essential retail stores. Under phase two, non-essential businesses, public spaces and faith-based entities will be allowed to reopen with precautionary measures in place. Restaurants will be able to offer indoor seating at up to 50 percent of maximum capacity. Indoor and outdoor pools, libraries, the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore, the National Aquarium and museums will be allowed to open with the same limited capacity requirements.

Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced that he is lifting the state’s stay-at-home order, replacing it with a public health advisory called “safer at home.” As of May 15 at 5 p.m., Marylanders are encouraged to stay at home, particularly those who are at-risk for contracting the coronavirus (COVID-19). However, retail stores and places of worship will be allowed to open, provided that they only permit half of their maximum capacity to enter at once. Additionally, businesses such as hair salons and barber shops are permitted to open, provided that they are appointment-only and conform to social distancing practices. This lifting of restrictions comes after a two-week plateau of COVID-19 cases in Maryland. However, leaders in certain areas of Maryland with more cases, such as Baltimore City, have decided to maintain stay-at-home restrictions for the time being.

Maryland Governor Larry Hogan issued an order this morning directing all Maryland residents to stay in their residences beginning at 8 p.m. tonight. This order also closed all non-essential businesses — including senior centers, restaurants and bars, fitness centers, theaters and malls — to the public. Under the order, members of the public are allowed to leave their residences to conduct certain essential activities. These include purchasing necessary household supplies, seeking medical attention or advice, providing necessary care for another, receiving a meal or instructional material from an educational institution, engaging in outdoor exercise and engaging in public business. The order specifies that any violation of its directives constitutes a misdemeanor offense and carries a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and one year in prison. Governmental bodies, media outlets and non-profit organizations serving low-income Marylanders are specifically excluded from the requirement of the order that all non-essential businesses close.

Baltimore City Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young announced that restaurants can resume indoor dining at 25 percent capacity beginning on Friday, August 7. This follows Young’s previous orders from July 24 to suspend all indoor dining services after a recent spike in coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in Maryland. Other gatherings are also still restricted, including: religious facilities, retail establishments, casinos and indoor recreation establishments. These establishments will be capped at whichever is lower — 25 percent capacity or 25 people. Young’s latest executive order excludes bars, which must remain closed. Outdoor gatherings can only have a maximum of 25 participants. Young’s new guidelines are stricter than the rest of Maryland.

On April 1, Pugh’s office announced that she would be taking an indefinite leave of absence to recover from pneumonia. This statement coincided with a report from The Baltimore Sun detailing that health care company Kaiser Permanente had purchased about 200,000 copies of Pugh’s Healthy Holly children’s books for $114,000 between 2015 and 2018. During this period, Kaiser Permanente was negotiating with the city’s spending panel to provide city

Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh resigned on Thursday, May 2 in light of controversy over sales of her children’s book series, becoming the second Baltimore mayor this decade to step down amid a criminal investigation. She apologized for the damage she has done to the legitimacy of her office and the face of the city in a statement her attorney Steven Silverman delivered at a news conference. “Dear citizens of Baltimore, I would like to thank you for allowing me to serve as the 50th mayor. It has been an honor and privilege,” Pugh said in the statement. “I’m sorry for the harm that I have caused to the image of the city of Baltimore and the credibility of the office of the mayor. Baltimore deserves a mayor who can move our great city forward.” After a month-long state investigation into her business dealings, Pugh has resigned, effective immediately. On April

President Brandon Scott of the Baltimore City Council won the Democratic primary for Baltimore Mayor with 29.46 percent of the vote on June 9. The official race call comes a week after the Maryland primary elections. After the in-person votes were tallied, former Baltimore Mayor Sheila Dixon held a slight lead over Scott. However, Scott finished with a 2,358-vote lead over Dixon once the mail-in ballots were factored into the results. Dixon was followed in votes by Mary Miller, Thiru Vignarajah, Incumbent Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young and T.J. Smith. A former representative for Baltimore’s second district, Scott received endorsements from several local officials, state officials and organizations, including the Baltimore Sun and Sunrise Movement Baltimore. His platform centers around a holistic crime reduction strategy and government transparency and accountability. Scott is expected to defeat Republican nominee Shannon Wright in the mayoral election in November. He shared his hopes as mayor

The killing of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police Department has sparked nationwide protests to highlight police brutality and promote racial justice. These protests have occurred in over 350 cities. In addition, people have shown their solidarity with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement through donations, petitions and social media. Although media coverage of the protests has recently propelled police brutality into the American spotlight, rising senior Bentley Addison noted that black Americans have felt this issue for years. “I think about it whenever I’m driving and I take a wrong turn, or when I’m walking in Baltimore and end up in a richer area, or when my brother leaves the house. This fear of ‘the next time it happens, is it going to be me or someone I know?’ is something that every black person in America lives with,” Addison said. “I vividly remember my father

In 1951, the Johns Hopkins Hospital took cervical cancer cells from Henrietta Lacks, a black Baltimore resident, and developed the HeLa cell line. Her cells contributed to major medical discoveries, including the development of polio vaccine. Neither Henrietta nor her family gave the Hospital permission to use her cells at the time. Some members of the Lacks family, who had formerly made peace with Hopkins after learning in the 1970s that it had taken Henrietta’s cells, now plan to sue the Hospital in the coming weeks. They also want compensation from other individuals and institutes, including the National Institute of Health (NIH); Rebecca Skloot, the author of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks; Crown Publishing; and HBO, which plans to release a movie starring Oprah Winfrey based on Skloot’s book. Hopkins Hospital claims it does not profit from Henrietta Lacks’ cells, stating that it never patented the HeLa cells and

On Thursday, April 18, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan approved legislation that will allow Hopkins to establish a private police force. By signing the bill – titled the Community Safety and Strengthening Act – into law, Hogan has authorized Hopkins to be the first private university in Maryland to have its own police force. University President Ronald J. Daniels released a statement where he praised the bill’s passage and explained the next steps for the planned police force. “The law will go into effect on July 1, 2019, after which we will enter a multiyear process of implementation. There will be many steps to come as we collaborate with the city of Baltimore, our neighbors, and the university community around the operational and public accountability structures for establishing the police department,” Daniels wrote.

Daniel Ennis, the University’s senior vice president for finance and administration, and Robert Kasdin, Hopkins Medicine’s senior vice president, chief financial officer and chief operating officer, announced on Thursday the opening of the application period for the University’s Police Accountability Board in an email to the community. The Accountability Board will be comprised of five community members unaffiliated with the University and 10 Hopkins students, faculty members and staff. In an interview with The News-Letter, Jarron Jackson, Campus Safety and Security senior director, explained that these ratios were set by the Community Strengthening Act — which established the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) — and supported through best-practices research.

Over 100 University faculty members have signed an open letter in opposition to Senate Bill (SB) 793 and House Bill (HB) 1094, which would allow Hopkins to create its own private police force. As of Feb. 20, 104 faculty had signed the letter. The open letter lists several concerns regarding the creation of a privately-owned University police force, including that this police force would undermine the relationship between Hopkins and the Baltimore community. “We believe that armed personnel introduce dangerous firearms and can decrease public safety, endanger our own students, and increase risk. We are concerned that once in place, police administrations will inevitably amplify the climate of fear and justify their roles by citing stops, arrests, and detainments,” the letter reads. “We wish to see the university taking on the role of constructive partner in a complex public issue of public health and educational equity and community well-being.” Susan

According to a UNITE HERE Local 7 announcement, the University has reneged on a private commitment it made in late March with union representatives to provide four weeks of uninterrupted pay for furloughed and laid-off contract workers. This announcement comes as one of many University attempts to cut costs. Two weeks ago, the University announced it planned to suspend contributions to most faculty and staff retirement plans, restrict faculty and staff hiring and freeze base salary increases for faculty and staff as part of austerity measures intended to cut the University’s losses in FY21.

Spring Fair has been an annual tradition at Hopkins for nearly half a century. Billed as the nation’s largest student-run festival, the event brings local musicians, carnival rides and community members to Homewood Campus. This fall, an organizational review in light of allegations of hazing, underage drinking and other violations of the Student Conduct Code prevented Spring Fair Committee (Spring Fair) from planning for the celebration, generally a yearlong endeavor. By now, the artist performing at the headliner concert the Saturday of Spring Fair has usually been selected. JHUnions and Programming Director Hal Turner, who oversees Spring Fair, told The News-Letter on Tuesday that the concert, typically held at Rams Head Live! downtown, will take place in the Recreation Center on April 18.

This fall, the Office of Student Leadership and Involvement (SLI) informed dozens of student groups that they had deficits in their accounts going back several years, sometimes upward of a decade. Some groups learned that they owed tens of thousands of dollars to the University, according to Student Government Association (SGA) Executive President AJ Tsang. SLI told two groups that they had accumulated over $100,000 in debt. “It’s unsettling that this much debt and these many deficits could have existed for as long as they have without being noticed,” Tsang said. “It’s worrying that current students are paying for mistakes that were made in the past, either by their distant predecessors or by SLI itself.” Tsang explained that while working with SLI, Dean of Student Life Smita Ruzicka, who joined the University this August, uncovered unpaid security charges for events, along with other previously unknown deficits.

For decades, Hopkins students have yearned for a student center: a central space for the collective pursuit of our social and mental wellbeing. Hopkins is an outlier. A student center exists at nearly every other college and university campus in the United States (including the 33 peer institutions to which Hopkins compares itself), but not here. More schools have a student center than an armed private police force. What are the benefits of a student center, and how could it revolutionize the Hopkins culture? Most importantly, a student center would allow Hopkins to centralize student services. We recognize that Hopkins provides many student services already and there are many dedicated staff who administer them. However, the core issue today is a lack of accessibility. Student services are spread so widely across campus that walking between the two farthest points where the University will offer student programming (R House and the

However, she said her follow-up counseling meeting was “disappointing in ways I really can’t even begin to describe.” Her therapist made recommendations which went against the advice of Casey’s other doctors and demonstrated a lack of basic understanding of the details from her initial appointment. “She recommended me to my own audiologist, for the program that I had described in detail the meeting before,” Casey said.

They believe that the extreme act of chaining themselves to the building will force the administration to begin negotiations. Hopkins Coalition Against ICE (HCAI) member Adela Chelminski has been involved the sit-in since the first day. She explained to The News-Letter that the protesters felt ignored by the administration and that continual demands for negotiations were rebuffed. “We are staying here through finals, and we are staying here through the summer if need

Editor’s Note: This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available. Vice Provost for Student Affairs Kevin Shollenberger and Vice President for Human Resources Heidi Conway sent a University-wide email addressing the eight student protesters who chained themselves to stairwells in Garland Hall at around 4 p.m. on Thursday, May 2. Student and community members began the Garland sit-in on April 3 to protest the planned private police force, the bill for which Maryland Governor Larry Hogan signed into law on April 18, and the University’s contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “Yesterday afternoon, the protesters dramatically escalated this situation by blocking ingress to and egress from the building, harassing staff and security officers, chaining the doors of the building closed, and covering security cameras. This escalation interrupted exams for students with disabilities, prevented student workers from being paid, and significantly disrupted financial aid

Three weeks ago, the Student Government Association (SGA) informed students that it would not be accepting new student organization applications this semester. The announcement also mentioned that SGA’s Committee on Student Organizations (CSO) would be working with the Office of Student Leadership and Involvement (SLI) to examine student groups’ practices, missions, funding and other criteria. SLI Director Calvin Smith, Jr., explained that SLI had already begun conducting audits on student groups, irrespective of CSO’s decision to enact the moratorium. The News-Letter spoke with students from SGA, Barnstormers, College Democrats, Spring Fair, Adoremus, Vocal Chords, Milton S. Eisenhower (MSE) Symposium and unrecognized groups about the impact of the audits and moratorium. Further, Smith shared his office’s plans to better support student groups.

The Office of Student Leadership and Involvement (SLI) announced at the beginning of last semester that, due to limitations enacted by the Center for Social Concern (CSC) and the Homewood Arts Program (HAP), they would prohibit students from forming new performing arts and local community service groups for this academic year. According to HAP Director Eric Beatty, it is plausible that the ban on new performing arts groups will carry into the 2018-19 academic year because of insufficient time and space for rehearsals and performances. He cited the delayed renovations of Shriver Hall, which serves as a performance venue, as an added difficulty. JHU Sirens President Isabella Zellerbach shared the difficulties her a cappella group faces in finding performance and practice space. “There are only a few locations on campus that are large enough... for end-of-year a cappella concerts,” she wrote in an email to The News-Letter. “We usually begin

After undergoing three semesters of renovations, Shriver Hall has been reopened to the Hopkins community. The renovation, which began during the fall of 2017, was slated to be completed by the beginning of spring 2018. University officials announced in February 2018, however, that the project would extend into the 2018-2019 academic year. Though Johns Hopkins Facilities and Real Estate (JHFRE) originally planned on only replacing the auditorium’s lighting and electrical systems, the project expanded to include new features to the auditorium. The renovation was also delayed so that JHFRE could take measures to eliminate the possibility of asbestos buildup within the building.

Many performing arts groups on campus are reporting significant budget cuts this year from the Student Activities Commission (SAC), which is the funding board of the Student Government Association (SGA). According to Hamilton Sawczuk, the business manager for theater group the Barnstormers, the group received a budget cut of almost 50 percent this year. Sawczuk stated that the Barnstormers will not be affected by the cuts this year, though the group is pursuing alternative sources of funding, such as external grants. However, he added that if the annual budget remains at this level in the future, the group would be limited in its ability to put on programming. “If this is the budget going forward for five years, then it’s going to have a big impact, at least, on where we get our money from, and if we’re able to put on the same level of productions as before,” he

The University has committed itself to “a series of broad-based and decisive austerity measures” in response to newly-projected large budgetary shortfalls in both the present fiscal year (FY) as well as FY21. University President Ronald J. Daniels announced these measures in an email to the Hopkins community on Tuesday night. The University’s prior budgetary projections had put Hopkins on track to achieve a $72 million budgetary surplus by the close of FY20. Before any attempts at mitigation are considered, Hopkins is now projected to stand at a nearly $100 million deficit, according to the Financial Implications and Planning (FIP) report. For FY21, the projection before any mitigation was considered was similarly revised from an $80 million surplus to a $375 million deficit. According to University of California, Santa Barbara Professor of Economics Dick Startz, these projected deficits are serious, especially in light of the University’s total budget. “You don’t have

The Student Government Association (SGA) discussed changes to funding for student groups at its last weekly meeting of the semester on April 28. Executive Treasurer Eric Armstrong announced that due to University-wide austerity measures, SGA’s operating budget will likely decrease for the next school year. SGA uses this budget to co-host events with student groups, such as Sex Week or Pi Phi Field Day. Annual funding for student groups from SGA’s Student Activities Commission (SAC) is also expected to decrease. Armstrong, however, noted that he requested greater funding for SAC’s monthly grants. SAC provides both annual funding and monthly grants to student groups. Increased funding for SAC’s monthly grants would be used to offset the budget cuts that student groups could face in the coming school year. Despite these economic strains, Senior Class Senator Chase McAdams noted that SGA is still approving student groups. Several new groups were approved this

Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM), observed in April, is an annual campaign to educate the public on how to prevent sexual violence. For the Sexual Assault Resource Unit (SARU), a student group that seeks to dismantle rape culture and support survivors of sexual violence, SAAM is an important opportunity to educate the student body.

SARU Co-Director Reah Vasilakopoulos, a senior, explained that the organization has had to think creatively about transitioning to an online platform.

Sophomore Madelynn Wellons, a survivor of sexual assault on Homewood campus, spoke out against Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos at a press conference on Jan. 25. Wellons shared her story outside the Department of Education headquarters in support of SurvJustice, Equal Rights Advocates and the Victim Rights Law Center, three law firms who filed a lawsuit against DeVos. The lawsuit alleges that the Department of Education discriminated against students who report sexual assault by rescinding the Dear Colleague Letter, an Obama-era guideline advising universities on how to address campus sexual assault. In September, DeVos issued her highly controversial decision to rescind these guidelines. One tenet of the guidelines was the suggested 60-day window to resolve cases of sexual assault. Wellons criticized the University for failing to address her case within this window. “In December 2016, I reported my sexual assault and stalking and it is now February 2018 and I

The University hired Westat, a Maryland-based research firm, to administer the survey and compile the report. About one third of Hopkins undergraduates and one quarter of Hopkins graduate students responded to the survey.

Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and alumnus of the Class of 1964, announced today that he will donate $1.8 billion to the University. The gift, which will be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid, is the largest donation to any U.S. college or university in history. The donation will allow the University to permanently conduct need-blind admissions, which means that family income will not be considered in the admissions process. Hopkins will also eliminate student loans from financial aid packages and instead offer scholarships that do not need to be repaid, beginning fall 2019. For spring 2019, the University will offer immediate loan relief to undergraduates whose financial aid package includes a federal need-based loan. Currently, over 44 percent of Hopkins students graduate with loan debt, which averages above $24,000. In an interview with The News-Letter, University President Ronald J. Daniels explained that Bloomberg’s donation comes

The Life Design Lab, previously the Homewood Career Center, is now focusing on allowing students to identify their strong areas of interests and inspiration and experimenting with them to advance their career. This marks a departure from the previous center, which was primarily based around career planning and the job search. The Life Design Lab has also moved from a transaction-based service model, where students signed up for one-on-one advisor meetings and which required a high number of staff and individual staff hours, to a more connection-based and community-based learning, in order to engage more students. To this end, the University has reorganized the Life Design Lab around fields of study. Staff members with the Life Design Lab have been redeployed to each of the departments across the Whiting School of Engineering and the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and are now referred to as life design educators.

As of this semester, all students living in Homewood dorms will be given a monthly allotment of $27 in laundry cash, which translates to 18 wash or dry cycles. The $27 in laundry cash that students receive comes directly from their existing housing fees. Previously, students had to spend $1.50 for each cycle, but with the new inclusive policy they are no longer required to pay any extra charge. Student Government Association (SGA) Senior Class President Pavan Patel, who spearheaded the initiative, told The News-Letter that it was all part of an effort to improve the student body’s quality of life. “Laundry is a basic necessity that everyone at Hopkins needs, especially people who don’t have as many resources,“ Patel said. “Something as small as laundry could pose a burden, so we wanted to make sure that students could focus on their academics and not have to worry about these

Refuel Our Future (Refuel) held the first Fossil Fuel Friday demonstration from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. on the steps of Gilman Hall last Friday. The group said that it will continue holding such demonstrations weekly until the University divests itself from the fossil fuel industry. The Hopkins board of trustees voted to divest itself from companies that produce thermal coal in December 2017, following six years of Refuel’s campaigning and a recommendation by the Public Interest Investment Advisory Committee. The demonstrators are demanding that the University divest itself more fully. At the event, Refuel executive board member Jeremy Berger, a junior, said that the decision to divest just from thermal coal was too small a measure. “Hopkins divested from thermal coal a couple of years ago, which is like divesting from Blockbuster Video. It is anachronistic and they should divest from all fossil fuels,” Berger said. Refuel organizer Elly

The Hopkins School of Medicine confirmed on Sept. 18 that it would be ending its controversial training contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This contract was held through the Center for Law Enforcement Medicine. However, at the time, some students questioned the accuracy and implications of this announcement. The News-Letter reached out to University officials to discuss the rationale behind choosing not to renew the contracts on Monday. According to Hopkins Medicine Senior Director of Public Relations and Corporate Communications Kim Hoppe, the decision stemmed from administrative issues. “Decisions about whether to seek and renew contracts depend on a multitude of factors,” Hoppe wrote in an email to The News-Letter. “In this case, due to complications related to the contracting process, including some delays in notification by the agency regarding its intentions, the Department of Emergency Medicine had to reallocate the substantial resources required to manage the program to

The Student Government Association (SGA) met this past Tuesday for their weekly meeting to discuss the difficulties regarding student elections this semester, as well as SGA’s role in the Sex Week planned for April. During the public input period of the meeting, a large group of student leaders met with SGA to broach concerns with club restructuring and budget allocations with the recent audit led by SGA and Student Leadership and Involvement (SLI). Senators expressed frustration with the lack of forewarning of the election application deadline. The Committee of Student Elections (CSE) sent out an email last Sunday that stated that mandated information sessions for candidates were scheduled for the next immediate two days. Junior Class Senator William Cho expressed his discomfort that the election turned out to be incumbent-heavy. He questioned the possibility of a special election with write-ins. “People only had one or two days to decide whether

The Student Government Association (SGA) held their final meeting of the semester on Tuesday, confirming the Committee on Student Organizations’s (CSO’s) audit decisions and passing several additional pieces of legislation. The CSO audit examined over 100 student organizations. Their decisions included deactivating 11 groups. Clubs were picked for deactivation either because of a failure to meet with SGA for the audit or an inability to pass the audit. The organizations being deactivated are the 22nd Century Interplanetary Diplomacy Club, ERUPTION, Jam Sessions, the Mahjong Club, the Modern Dance Company, Health Guardians of America, Students for Justice in Palestine, Take Back the Tap, The Dialectic, Throat Culture and VIVAZ. Senior Class Senator Chase McAdams, who introduced the bill, said that he stands firmly in favor of deactivating these clubs, most of which fail to meet the requirement of having 10 members. “This was very clearly communicated multiple times throughout the semester.

University President Ronald J. Daniels announced in an email to the student body on Wednesday, March 18 that in-person classes and University events are suspended through the rest of the spring semester due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. This year’s commencement, he added, will be held virtually. On Tuesday, March 10, Daniels had announced that Hopkins would be canceling in-person classes and transitioning all undergraduate courses to remote instruction through at least April 12. His March 18 email extends this transition through the end of the spring semester. Students will be credited, he wrote, for the balance of their housing and dining contracts. “Community transmission of the virus is accelerating nationally and within our region, and we continue to be guided by public health authorities and infectious disease and epidemiological experts at Johns Hopkins who are now urging all of us to observe stricter social distancing protocols for a

All residential students must leave campus by 5 p.m. on March 15. Vice Provost for Student Affairs Alanna Shanahan emailed all students who live in University housing by Friday instructing them to vacate residential buildings. The email stated that there would be certain exceptions for those “who cannot return home due to international travel restrictions, financial hardship or other extraordinary circumstances.” The announcement, sent through the Housing Office, follows the University’s announcement on Tuesday, March 10 that Hopkins will be suspending in-person classes through at least April 12 due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. For the time they are not on campus, Shanahan wrote, students will be credited for their housing and dining costs. “We are taking these steps after consulting with experts in public health and infectious disease who advised us to significantly reduce the number of students residing on campus in highly concentrated living, dining and studying

Following the cancellation of in-person classes through the rest of the semester as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, student organizations have been forced to adapt their processes. Members of these student groups spoke with The News-Letter to explain how they have handled the pandemic. Sophomore Kylie Sharron, external training director for A Place to Talk (APTT), a peer listening group on campus, explained that the move to remote learning has severed the essential face-to-face interaction aspect of the organization. “We are working diligently to figure out a means to continue to connect with the student body throughout the chaos of the rest of this semester,” Sharron said. Another organization that faces similar problems with transitioning to a virtual platform is the Sexual Assault Resource Unit (SARU), a student-run advocacy group that supports survivors of sexual violence.

Nearly two years ago, then-sophomores Bridget Chen and Chanel Lee founded the student group Wings, with hopes of bringing free and accessible menstrual products to Hopkins. This Monday, Wings launched the Menstrual Products Initiative (MPI) pilot program, installing free tampon and pad dispensers in eight women’s restrooms and two all-gender restrooms across Homewood Campus. The pilot program, scheduled to end on April 20, is funded by the Office of Women and Gender Resources and co-sponsored by the Office of the Dean of Student Life. According to Lee, the dispensers will be restocked at least twice a week by 30 student volunteers. Facilities and Custodial Services, Lee added, will assist these efforts. Lee underscored the need to destigmatize periods and promote menstrual health on campus. “Do we talk about periods in regular conversations? No, we don’t, because it’s almost embarrassing, even when it’s a naturally occurring bodily function,” they said. “When

Feminine hygiene products will be available in the women’s restrooms in Brody Learning Commons (Brody Atrium, Q-Level and M-Level), in the Fresh Food Café (FFC) and outside Nolan’s. In addition, students will be able to find them at front desks of Levering Café, Mattin Center and the Recreation Center. At the start of every week, each desk will receive 20 tampons and 20 pads, and each restroom 28 tampons and 28 pads. The SGA will refill the desk locations once a week and the restroom locations every three days. The bill was partly inspired by an article written for The News-Letter in 2014 titled “Campus feminine hygiene supply is inadequate.” In the article, Will Marcus criticizes the lack of selection and high cost of feminine products sold on campus. He also argues that the lack of accessibility and availability of hygiene products makes buying them an unnecessary and major inconvenience.

While menstruation is a normal and regular bodily process, restrooms on the Homewood Campus do not provide menstrual products — a necessity for around half the population. To address this, juniors Chanel Lee and Bridget Chen founded the student group Wings to bring free and accessible menstrual products to campus. Lee explained why they felt it was important to fight for better access to menstrual products. “It’s immoral to tax a normal human bodily function. Menstrual products are not easily available and affordable to everyone. That is a fact,“ Lee said. “They are expensive, especially when buying on a routine basis.” On Nov. 8, 2016, Student Government Association (SGA) members passed a bill to have free menstrual health products available in women’s restrooms. Junior Class President Dean Chien explained that it took the SGA Senate a month to figure out how to implement the bill. They created a small committee

In an email addressed to the Hopkins community, University President Ronald J. Daniels announced that the University will face serious financial challenges as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Daniels expressed gratitude for affiliates’ rapid response to changes made to the academic year, but did not shy away from the daunting monetary effects the virus will have on employment, aid, research and salaries. “Our university is not immune to the very serious negative effects of COVID-19. Today, I write to speak frankly with you about the substantial financial challenges our university is confronting and the measures we are undertaking to meet them, including actions that will directly and significantly affect our employees,” the email states. According to a more detailed report of financial projections, the University is expected to lose over $100 million for the 2020 fiscal year.

The University’s 2020 Research Workgroup held its second town hall on May 20. The event’s purpose was to encourage feedback on the Workgroup’s guidelines for resuming research this year. The Workgroup is currently examining the impact of lab management and safety strategies during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and has helped develop a three-phase reopening plan. The guidelines give advice for phase one for restarting research on campus. According to the document, the University is currently in phase zero, which allows only research related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to occur. In the final and third stage, there will be a full return of research operations. Phase one, which the University hopes to begin soon, refers to an increase of research activity with a low on-campus density.

The University shared a draft plan for Phase Two of its reopening in an email to Hopkins affiliates on Dec. 18. The plan is intended to go into effect when the spring semester begins on Jan. 25 and will replace the Phase One plans implemented during the fall semester. The release of the draft guide, however, does not signify that Hopkins has determined whether to carry out the proposed hybrid reopening plans. The final decision will be made during the week of Jan. 4. Stephen Gange, executive vice provost for academic affairs, and Jane Schlegel, vice president and chief administrative officer, emphasized in the email that ensuring the health and safety of all affiliates requires a community effort. “Moving to an expanded operating posture at the appropriate time is a challenge that will require the help of every member of our community, but our experience so far gives us confidence

Hopkins welcomed students back on campus for its hybrid spring reopening with limited in-person activities and housing. Students are required to adhere to a number of safety protocols related to COVID-19, including a mask mandate and asymptomatic testing. The move-in process for University housing began on Jan. 16. Additional rules residential students must follow include mandatory biweekly testing, face coverings and social distancing. Mass gatherings are prohibited, and students are not allowed to enter residential buildings or dorm rooms not assigned to them. There is a blanket ban on having any guests, including other residential students, inside rooms.

In a news conference at Park Height’s Zeta Center, Scott justified lifting the ban, citing the city’s decrease in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations.

Additionally, restaurants are required to maintain sign-in and sign-out sheets for guests to assist with contact tracing and diners will only be permitted to stay for one hour.

In response to the pandemic, the University altered its spring break schedule to minimize traveling off campus. Instead of granting students an entire week off, the University scheduled five days without classes interspersed throughout the semester. So far, students have had two of their five spring break days and, although they have found ways to enjoy their days off, the move has raised concerns about mental health. Junior Dmytro Nebesh, the president of the mental health and well-being organization Peabuddies, believes that the University did not do enough to ensure that students could rest on break days. “We’re not really given time off. We’re just given time off from Zoom,” he said. “Especially at Peabody, there are rehearsals [and] lessons still scheduled.

Moving to a new city presents the opportunity to explore a brand-new culinary landscape.

It can be difficult to explore outside your college campus whilst managing a busy schedule. But it is possible to find time to spend with friends outside of the tight confinements of the Hopkins campus. Every year, at least one senior will tell you something along the lines of “don’t get stuck in the Hopkins bubble.” But what does this even mean? Given that the campus is located in a cultural city with plenty of food vendors to visit and unique architecture to see, it would be a shame to not experience the city outside of campus during your undergraduate years.

It truly was another unprecedented summer. As vaccines became more readily available and COVID-19 cases in Baltimore declined this past June, Hopkins relaxed its indoor mask mandate and weekly testing policies. Many students felt optimistic that the fall would represent as close a return to normal as possible. The second half of this idealized “shot girl summer” presented a reality check. With a rise in cases associated with the delta variant, Hopkins reinstated indoor masking. Just this week, the University reversed course and told fully vaccinated students living off-campus that they would need to be tested once a week. With so much change, is the phrase “So good to be back” a statement of truth, or one of sarcasm? Though the blue and green interior is familiar, Brody feels more like a Zoom cafe than a hangout spot. Freshmen still look to meal times as opportunities to socialize, but they

The Mattin Center will soon be leveled to make room for the construction of the new student center, which is scheduled to open in fall 2024. Designed by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, the same firm designing the Barack Obama Presidential Center, the four buildings that make up Mattin have served the arts community on the Homewood Campus since 2001. According to Alanna Klos, project manager at Hopkins Facilities and Real Estate, the demolition of the Mattin Center is slated to begin in late May and will be completed by the end of the fall semester.

The statue Spirit of Music, located south of the Mattin Center, was erected last week to commemorate the late Hopkins student Rex Chao. Chao was shot and killed in close proximity to the Milton S. Eisenhower Library by fellow student Robert J. Harwood on April 10, 1996. Walking back to their respective dorms from a College Republicans meeting, Harwood shot Chao twice with a .357 Magnum after becoming engrossed in an argument. In response to the tragic event, the Rex Chao Memorial Committee was created in 1996 to honor the memory of Chao. Former girlfriend Suzanne Hubbard and close friend AmyClair Brusch co-chaired the committee, with the support of five other close friends of Chao. The committee focused on raising money in order to memorialize their friend and fellow student. Over the past six years, the committee has raised more than $70,000 to cover the statue, the base and other

The Blue Jays bested the McDaniel Green Terror this past Tuesday, achieving a 9-5 victory, the result of a combination of strong Hopkins play, as well as several McDaniel errors. The Blue Jays have moved to 13-8-2 on the season, and 4-1 in the Centennial as the Blue Jays enter their second week of Conference play. Contrasting Hopkins's strong start, scoring nine runs in the first four innings, McDaniel started the game very poorly, setting a tone that would be prevalent for almost the entire game This tone was reflected in a first-inning error, which allowed the Blue Jays to scoot ahead 2-0. In the second inning, a passed ball saw junior second baseman Adam Weiner reach scoring position, and he eventually scored to extend the lead to three runs. Two more runs were scored in the third inning off of sophomore Mike Denlinger's first career home run, giving Hopkins

When I was talking to my editors, the idea of Low Culture was really appealing. I like network TV and popcorn movies. I like superhero comic books and shoot 'em up video games. And, at first, I was pretty convinced the active word was the "TV" or the "movie" aspects, when really I was talking about the "network" or "popcorn" aspects. Artsy films? Oscar-winning stuff? HBO or AMC dramas? Even indie video games, music or comics? That's not what Low Culture is about. Low Culture is about the everyday stuff, and finding the magic in it.

May 3, 2012 This single of the week, "Doom," is brought to you by Brooklyn-based band New Beard. "Doom" is off their new album, New Beard City. New Beard is comprised of frontman Ben Wigler, drummer Tony Waldman, tubist TubaJoe Exley (no, I'm not kidding) and one-named Yazan, the guitarist. New Beard has also recently added a new member (and instrument!) to the mix: Maria Christina Eisen, on saxophone. It seems as though New Beard is set on defying any definitive genre type. With influences from bands ranging from Elliot Smith to Megadeath and genres from folk to progressive rock, it is clear that New Beard is anything but typical. Their producer, Gustav Ejstes of Dungen, adds synthesizer to their music and puts the final, eclectic touch on the album.Frontman Wigler also has considerable experience to add to the group from his days with his previous band, Arizona.

SGA falls short with election remedy - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

May 3, 2012 A recent amendment passed by the SGA details clearer rules governing the conduct by members of the SGA during elections. Prior to this amendment, SGA members were only advised to maintain appropriate behavior during elections. Unlike candidates vying for a position on SGA, current members did not have concrete guidelines under the Committee on Student Elections (CSE). This page agrees that increased clarity and transparency is needed in the rules governing the behavior of current SGA members in order to maintain the integrity of the elections each year. The amendment states that, "members of the SGA should be held to a higher standard pursuant to the office they were elected to." The background of an SGA member merits increased standards during elections. We believe that the amendment should go further, addressing concrete points to level the playing field. The SGA should work to decrease negative campaigning and

The University released the final designs for the student center on Nov. 2. The facility is scheduled to open in fall 2024 and will serve as a non-academic space for students and student organizations, featuring auditoriums, digital labs, dining options and areas for relaxation. Plans to build a new student center were first announced in March 2019. The University has since worked to collect student input, surveying 1,200 University affiliates in June to help choose the design. The student center’s 150,000-square-foot design was created by Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) and will be built where the Mattin Center currently stands. The final design was selected by the Student Center Advisory Committee, which is made up of 25 faculty members, staff, students and alumni and chaired by Vice Provost for Student Affairs Alanna Shanahan. In an interview with The News-Letter, senior Simi Aluko expressed excitement for the new building. “I really love

University administrators announced updates to its fall health guidelines in an email broadcast yesterday. In line with changes to the citywide mask mandate, individuals who upload proof of vaccination will no longer be required to wear masks indoors or outdoors and may also eat and drink without social distancing. Testing for vaccinated individuals will be required only once a week. The decision is consistent with several peer institutions. Ivy League schools like Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania have lifted the mask mandate for vaccinated individuals. In an interview with The News-Letter, incoming freshman Sofia Melamed said that she is not surprised by the relaxation of guidelines given that the public health situation has improved considerably in Maryland. “Restrictions are only needed [when] COVID-19 infections are putting significant strain on the healthcare system,” she said. “At the moment, they are not in the United States and Maryland in particular.” National

Baltimore City Mayor Brandon Scott announced on June 16 that the citywide mask mandate and state of emergency will be lifted as of July 1. Scott noted that businesses and workplaces will be allowed to continue their own mask mandates. These new mask guidelines came the day after Maryland Governor Larry Hogan did the same for the state. Rising sophomore Jabari Lawrence agreed with the decision to lift the mandate but was unsure why July 1 was the chosen date. “It seems like decisions to lift mandates recently have been a bit arbitrary,” he said. “I just wish they would explain why they decide these particular dates. I think people would be much less confused and taken aback if they did.” Rising sophomore Ilana Chalom does not plan on changing her masking behavior. “I still wear my mask everywhere,” she said.

University leaders announced updates to the University’s fall semester COVID-19 policies in an email to constituents on Wednesday. The broadcast reiterated the vaccination requirement for students announced in April and extended the mandate to all faculty and staff. Barring religious or medical exemptions, all Hopkins affiliates will be required to upload their proof of vaccination by August 1 through the University’s COVID-19 vaccine registration system, which will be launched July 1. International students will be eligible for free vaccinations upon their arrival to Hopkins and have until September 30 to submit proof of vaccination. As of June 12, Maryland’s vaccination rate of 50.6% is seven percentage points ahead of the national rate. However, only 40.0% of Baltimore residents are fully vaccinated. Hopkins is not alone in requiring vaccinations: Many peer institutions — including Stanford University, Emory University and all eight Ivy League schools — are also mandating vaccinations for all

Hopkins announced plans on Friday to largely return to normal this fall. Most classes will be held in person, and COVID-19 vaccines will be required for students. On-campus housing will be open at near-full capacity, and residency requirements will be reinstated for freshmen and sophomores. Administrators will determine face covering requirements based on public health conditions closer to the fall. Junior Sylvana Schaffer supports the University’s decision. “This is basically the best announcement Hopkins has made since the beginning of the pandemic,” she said. “After three semesters of largely virtual education, I think that bringing students back to campus and returning to largely in-person learning is vital.” Sophomore Andrea Guillen called on the University to provide more information about student organization activities. “There is no information about clubs, which I would really appreciate,” she said. “One of my clubs, the Witness Theatre Company, is struggling right now to find space

Throughout the hybrid spring semester, Hopkins has established isolation and quarantine housing for students who test positive for COVID-19 or come into close contact with someone who tested positive. There are currently 343 rooms reserved for this purpose at AMR III, the McCoy Hall, the Inn at the Colonnade and an additional Hopkins-owned property. Isolation housing is used for COVID-19-positive students, while quarantine housing is for those who have had a meaningful contact with a person who tested positive. As of Friday, both isolation and quarantine housing are largely empty, with seven isolation housing units in use. According to Assistant Vice President of External Relations for the Office of Communications Karen Lancaster, students who test positive will receive a call from a HelWell nurse with instructions to relocate. The nurse will regularly follow up on physical and emotional health until the end of the isolation period. Similar processes occur for

The spring semester is a small step closer to the pre-pandemic college experience as a select number of courses have become in-person and limited on-campus activities resume. In-person classes, however, faced hiccups as they were first pushed back due to severe winter weather and then were suspended after two days due to a surge in positive COVID-19 cases among students. Suspension of in-person classes and activities was extended twice but resumed on Feb. 12. Due to bad weather, the University shut down this Thursday, and in-person classes were suspended once again. Sophomore Sarah Ann Duck expressed frustration about the frequent suspension of in-person activities, particularly her psychology research. “I was unable to do any research last semester due to the COVID-19 restrictions and have been hoping that I will be able to begin this semester,“ she said. “Thursday was the fourth week in a row that my start date got

Some previously announced measures, however, have been relaxed. Students living in Charles Commons are now allowed to leave quarantine and no longer have to get daily COVID-19 tests. Student athletes still have to be tested every day and remain in their residences. All other undergraduate students have to be tested three times a week.

On March 14, he was called upon to help the nation during the pandemic.

Loh announced the approval of the app on iOS and Android this May. In an interview with The News-Letter, Loh explained the rationale behind his contact tracing app. “One of the parts of COVID-19 that’s so bad is it spreads before you know you have it,” Loh said. “How do we find a way to reduce the spread if it’s spreading invisibly? That’s how the idea for building the network came in.” NOVID users self-report positive COVID-19 cases, which

The University resumed in-person classes and lifted the ban on indoor and outdoor gatherings on Thursday, Feb. 11.

Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced on Monday that all residents 16 and older are eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at mass vaccination sites, effective April 6. This change is based on an anticipated increase in supplies from the federal government. The state will require other providers to offer COVID-19 vaccines starting April 12. In a press conference announcing the update, Hogan expressed hope that Maryland will be able to move quickly and vaccinate as many people as possible. “Even though we’re opening up eligibility for everyone, that does not mean everyone will be able to immediately get an appointment,” he said. “If [the federal government] continues to provide vaccines the way they’ve led us to believe, we should be able to finish everybody who wants one during April and May.” This announcement comes alongside President Joe Biden’s decision to move up the deadline for states to make all Americans

As Maryland moves into phase 1C of its COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan, over two million Marylanders are now eligible for the vaccine. Phase 1C expands vaccine eligibility to people over 65 and more essential workers in lab services, agriculture and manufacturing. The state government website reports that the federal government is currently providing Maryland approximately 10,000 doses daily, far below the current demand. Because of this transition, more Hopkins affiliates are getting vaccinated. In an email to University affiliates on Jan. 22, Provost Sunil Kumar and Interim Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration Mary Miller noted the ongoing efforts to support eligible Hopkins affiliates and Baltimore residents in receiving the vaccine. Hopkins Hospital has established a partnership with the Baltimore City Public Schools to help vaccinate K-12 teachers and staff.

Last week, some Hopkins undergraduates began volunteering at M&T Bank Stadium, one of three mass vaccination sites in Baltimore, to offer non-clinical support services through the Vaccine Volunteer Project. The COVID-19 working group of the office of University President Ronald J. Daniels partnered with the Center for Social Concern (CSC) and the state of Maryland to launch the project. According to CSC Executive Director Misti McKeehen, this partnership was conceived in order to extend the University’s COVID-19 response beyond the immediate community of Hopkins and into Baltimore and Maryland. “As we identified the mass vaccination sites with the state of Maryland, Vice Provost [Alanna] Shanahan was asked to dedicate Student Affairs support,” she said. “That’s where I had the pleasure of coming in to assist with the planning and implementation of the large, long-term volunteer effort that will take quite a bit of coordination in the coming months.” Shifts are

In a reversal from previous fall semester masking guidelines, the University announced earlier today that it will reimpose the indoor masking mandate and reinstate social distancing requirements for indoor dining. According to the email, the policies will take effect August 5 for all affiliates, regardless of vaccination status. Baltimore City Mayor Brandon Scott reinstated the city's indoor mask mandate as well, it will take effect across Baltimore on Monday, August 9 at 9 a.m. Exceptions to the University’s renewed mask mandate include in single-occupancy and shared office settings where 6-foot distancing can be maintained; among roommates in residence halls, dorms, suites and apartments; and while eating and drinking at least 6 feet from another person. The Office of the Provost may also approve exceptions in instructional settings if provided with pedagogic rationale and sufficient distancing is possible.

In a reversal from previously declared policy, the University announced in an email on August 19 that it will only accept COVID-19 vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which currently includes the Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccines. The University had previously stated that it would accept World Health Organization (WHO) approved vaccines, such as Oxford/AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, Sinovax, Covishield or Novavax. However, the administration claimed that they did not view these vaccines as effective against the more aggressive and highly prevalent delta variant. As a result, those who have received non-FDA-approved vaccines are required to get re-vaccinated with those that are approved by the FDA. Vice President for Communications Andrew Green noted in an email to The News-Letter that students needing to get re-vaccinated will be under the same health restrictions as unvaccinated individuals. “Students who require re-vaccination will be allowed on campus and to participate

The Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) has been at the center of public debate since the University first announced its plans to create a private police force in 2018. In 2019, protesters chained themselves to stairwells in Garland Hall to protest the planned police force. The sit-in lasted for a month and ended with the arrest of seven people, four of whom were students. Hopkins students also marched with residents of Douglass Homes, a public housing complex near the Hopkins Hospital, and local activist organizations to protest the potential introduction of the JHPD into the community. In 2020, the marble sign on the Merrick Gateway and parts of the Mattin Center were spray-painted with messages such as “Justice 4 Floyd” and “No JHUPD” following nationwide protests against police brutality. In late June of that year, students and community groups also marched to the home of University President Ronald J. Daniels

This past Monday, with no prior warning, Hopkins students received an email from University President Ronald J. Daniels and CEO of Hopkins Medicine Paul B. Rothman regarding a bill that is being introduced this week in the Maryland General Assembly. The bill “would give private colleges and universities in Baltimore City the authority to work with the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) to create a university police department.” This University police department would function alongside the pre-existing Hopkins security team, and it would be “developed and implemented through a detailed agreement with the BPD.” The school hopes to still consult faculty, students, staff and community representatives to help develop what they hope will become a “model university police department.” This email came as a surprise to students, and seems to raise more questions than it answers. It is unclear whether the the University police would be a branch of the BPD,

Over 200 members of the Hopkins and Baltimore community protested the creation of a Hopkins private police force, as well as the University’s contracts with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), on Wednesday in Wyman Park Dell. Shortly after the rally, demonstrators marched to University President Ronald J. Daniels’ house. They then continued on to Garland Hall, where members of Students Against Private Police (SAPP) and the Hopkins Coalition against ICE were holding a 24-hour sit-in that had begun earlier that afternoon. These protests responded to the final approval of the Community Safety and Strengthening Act, which the Maryland General Assembly passed on April 1. This legislation will allow the University to create its own police force. Several other organizations, including National Nurses United (NNU), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), CASA de Maryland and Baltimore Democratic Socialists of America also participated in the rally.

On Saturday, residents of Douglass Homes, a public housing complex near Hopkins Hospital, protested the University’s alleged interest in purchasing the complex and the potential introduction of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) into the community. In addition to tenants of Douglass Homes, several local activist organizations were present, including the People’s Power Assembly, Ujima People’s Progress Party, Baltimore for Border Justice and the Maryland chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. Demonstrators marched from North Dallas Court to North Broadway, right in front of the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Building on the medical campus. Several Hopkins students participated in the protest. Sebastian Link, a Sociology graduate student who participated in the sit-in at Garland Hall, questioned the University’s policies in an interview with The News-Letter. The month-long occupation of Garland in protest of the planned private police force ended on May 8 with the arrests of seven people, including

The marble sign on the Merrick Gateway and parts of the Mattin Center were spray-painted with messages such as “Justice 4 Floyd” and “No JHUPD” following nationwide protests against police brutality on May 31. The University has since covered the sign with tarp, surrounded it with fences and is in the process of removing the messages. Ignited by the killing of 46-year-old George Floyd by a white police officer in the Minneapolis Police Department, these protests have spotlighted the Black Lives Matter movement and systemic racial injustice in the U.S. Although many protests have been peaceful, there have been multiple instances of vandalism, looting and arson in major cities. Rising sophomore Cionne Gates expressed her support for the messages left on the sign in an email to The News-Letter.

About 100 protesters marched to University President Ronald J. Daniels’ home on June 29, taping copies of a petition demanding the cancellation of the private police force to his front door and windows. The rally was organized and endorsed by numerous student and community groups, including Teachers and Researchers United (TRU), an unofficial graduate student union; Baltimore Bloc, a grassroots collective that aims to rebuild communities; and the Garland Sit-In and Occupation (Sit-In). First gathering at the Harriet Tubman Grove, demonstrators called on Hopkins to cut its ties with the Baltimore Police Department and to better invest in surrounding Black communities. The rally was held in solidarity with Black Lives Matter and nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice.

University President Ronald J. Daniels and other administrators announced the suspension of the implementation of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) for at least two years in an email on June 12. This announcement followed nationwide protests against racism and police brutality prompted by the killing of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police Department. While rising senior Smitha Mahesh was surprised that University leaders responded to student outcry, she was dissatisfied that they did not take the decision further. “All these petitions, protests, and outcry from students, faculty, the Hopkins community and the whole of Baltimore City community have been very clear that there should be a complete abolishment of the private police force,” she said. “ I ask the question — why wait? Why pause? We should completely abolish the private police right now.” In April 2019, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan signed the Community Safety and

The Judiciary Committee of the Maryland House of Delegates held a session on Feb. 23 to discuss House Bill 336 (HB0336) and House Bill 1284 (HB1284). Both bills, if passed, will repeal past laws related to the establishment and maintenance of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD). HB0336 would also prohibit all private universities in Maryland from establishing their own police forces. Following nationwide protests last summer after the death of George Floyd, University President Ronald J. Daniels announced that all plans related to the JHPD would be halted for at least two years. In late August, the University also paused the Police Accountability Board, tasked with overseeing the formation of the JHPD. At the session, Delegate Julian Ivey, sponsor of HB0336, underscored the importance of addressing nationwide calls for police reform. “We must take the necessary steps to restore the public’s trust with the already established police departments we

Vice President for Economic Development Alicia Wilson, one of the University leaders overseeing this fund, stated in an interview with The News-Letter that the fund will be open to any program, whether new or established, wishing to throw its hat into the ring. “The main goals of this fund are really to let community organizations, students and faculty have the ability to innovate around how to address community safety and community wellness,” she said. “Many times organizations and groups know how to solve the problems that are present in their community, but they usually are not given the space... and resources to do so.” Wilson stressed that the University wants to support initiatives that are community-led, regardless of whether

The state legislature passed the Community Safety and Strengthening Act in April 2019, authorizing the University to have its own police force. Governor Larry Hogan promptly signed it into law. In response, Hopkins students launched a month-long sit-in at Garland Hall in protest, resulting in arrests of four students after the Baltimore police and fire departments were called to evict the protestors.

The letter, which was sent on Jan. 13, detailed six major concerns shared by the signatories, highlighting the negative impacts a private police force could have on the greater city of Baltimore. The letter states that the signatories continue to oppose a private police force and believe that instead, the University should dedicate its resources to addressing the root cause of crime. Some solutions faculty members endorsed are mental health resources, youth-oriented education programs and offering public health services for drug addiction, citing experts from both the University itself and active community members. “Johns Hopkins can do far more to repair its reputation and enhance the safety and wellbeing of our Institutions and the residents of Baltimore by focusing on what it

CAPH member Mihir Chaudhary, who graduated from the Bloomberg School of Public Health in May, argued in an interview with The News-Letter that the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) would exacerbate racial inequity in Baltimore. “The police is the crown of this process of gentrification.

First, my personal reasons for joining the Board had not been met or fulfilled.

“We realize that 2015 has defined American policing and its future in a very different way,” Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said at a recent Foreign Affairs Symposium (FAS) panel on policing on March 22. Tuesday marked one year since the arrest of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man and Baltimore native. His death one week later from a severe spinal cord injury sparked more than a week of both peaceful and violent protesting that gained national attention. The issue of police misconduct, which has been under increased scrutiny since the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. in 2014, came to a head in Baltimore last April. “We’re the nation’s eighth largest police department,” Davis said, “and for far too many years, our agency, like other agencies that struggle with violence, really turned into a one-dimensional police department where the only thing that mattered was reducing violence.” The FAS

In addition, the University is launching an epidemiological surveillance study that will test volunteered participants regularly to better monitor the spread of the COVID-19 on the Homewood Campus.

You may have been surprised to see the University’s announcement regarding spring 2021 earlier this month. You were more than likely happy about it, but you were definitely still surprised. Something seemed a bit off. On the same day that Vice Provost for Student Affairs Alanna Shanahan and Executive Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Stephen Gange sent an email to Hopkins undergraduates titled “Welcoming you to campus this spring,” the U.S. reported its highest seven-day average of COVID-19 cases yet. Just a few days earlier, Dr. Anthony Fauci told The Washington Post, “All the stars are aligned in the wrong place... You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.” This contrast should be treated as a flashing red warning sign.

It was unrealistic for administrators to expect all students to remain at home. We are stuck in leases that the University encouraged us to sign. Students had to decide whether it was safer to return to campus rather than live with at-risk family members. International students had to choose between moving back to Baltimore and facing unreasonable time zone differences. However, Hopkins made an exception for students who have a demonstrated hardship due to their situation at home or educational needs. These students are now being housed on-campus. We applaud Hopkins for acknowledging that staying home is not a realistic option

Nine Hopkins professors have signed an open letter calling for President Donald Trump’s removal from office after his actions encouraged far-right rioters to storm the Capitol building on Wednesday, Jan 6. As of publication, the open letter has been signed by over 1300 political scientists, including Hopkins professors Filipe Campante, Hahrie Han, Dan Honig, Margaret E. Keck, Renée Marlin-Bennett, Adam Seth Levine, Olga Oliker, Sarah E. Parkinson and Adam Sheingate. The letter urges lawmakers to either impeach Trump or invoke the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. “The President’s actions threaten American democracy,” the letter reads. “Our profession seeks to understand politics, not engage in it, but we share a commitment to democratic values. The President’s actions show he is unwilling or unable to fulfill his oath to protect and defend the Constitution. He should be removed from office immediately before further violence takes place or further damage is

Vice President for Public Safety Dr. Branville Bard Jr. sent an email to the Hopkins community containing updates on the implementation of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) on August 23. The email explained that over the past year, the University has devoted time to strengthening the University’s public safety organization. This includes improving operations through existing security officers and implementing crisis intervention, gender identity awareness and trauma-informed training. The office has also implemented the new Behavioral Health Crisis Support Team, a nontraditional approach to reducing violence that pairs public safety officers with clinicians to support community members experiencing personal crises. Bard also explained how the University's Innovation Fund for Community Safety recently celebrated its first year of completion. The initiative aims to support community-led initiatives in Baltimore to address housing insecurity, job training, education, community organizing and more.

One year after pausing efforts to create the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD), the University announced the nine winners of its $6 million Innovation Fund for Community Safety. According to the University, the purpose of the fund is to bolster community initiatives aimed at reducing violent crime. These programs will take place near University campuses in Mount Vernon, Charles Village and East Baltimore. Despite these investments in non-policing alternatives to public safety, Vice President for Communications Andrew Green wrote in an email to The News-Letter that the University plans to move forward with the creation of the JHPD. In an interview with The News-Letter, Alicia Wilson, vice president for economic development for the University and its health system, explained that the goal of the initiative was to involve the community in tackling safety issues on and near campus and to deliver community-focused solutions.

Hopkins announced the creation of the Johns Hopkins University Behavioral Health Crisis Support Team (JHU BHCST) to respond to behavioral and mental health crises on and around Homewood Campus on May 18. In an email to constituents, University President Ronald J. Daniels, Acting Vice President for Public Safety Connor Scott and Vice Provost for Student Health and Well-Being Kevin Shollenberger promoted the initiative as part of the University’s commitment to reimagining public safety. They noted that currently, campus safety and security officers are the first and sole in-person responders to behavioral health crises. In an interview with The News-Letter, Scott clarified that the team will pair behavioral health clinicians with Crisis-Intervention-Trained (CIT) security officers during shifts seven days a week. The team will be dispatched by the Counseling Center or Security Office, which receive the calls, and the clinician will take the lead in the response. Shollenberger stated that the

Earlier this semester, the University announced the official launch of the Behavioral Health Crisis Support Team (BHCST). In an email to the student body on Nov. 9, administration stated that the initiative will begin with a pilot program on Homewood Campus and gradually expand to the entirety of the University. As of Dec. 10, the team has responded to four distress calls for students and one distress call for a community member, according to Vice Provost for Student Health and Well-Being Kevin Shollenberger and Director of Media Relations Jill Rosen. Jarron Jackson, senior director of the Office of Campus Safety and Security (Campus Security), explained why his security team views the BHCST as a crucial element for Campus Security’s response to people in crises in an interview with The News-Letter. “21st-century public safety is really about problem solving,” he said. “I think that need is best fit by a dual

The University held a town hall meeting on Sept. 22 in Shriver Hall to hear community feedback on an initial draft of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The event was disrupted by protesters, forcing the school to move the town hall online. In 2020, the University announced a two-year pause on the implementation of the JHPD following student protests. At the beginning of the fall semester of 2022, the University announced intentions to resume the development of a private police force. In an interview with The News-Letter, Vice President for Public Safety Dr. Branville Bard Jr. explained that establishing a private police force is necessary to keep campus safe. “The prevailing model at colleges and universities is to provide policing services as part of a comprehensive public safety strategy,” he said. “It’s not anything new.

For over a week, members of the Hopkins and Baltimore community have participated in a sit-in at Garland Hall to protest the proposed private police force and the University’s contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The protest is organized by Students Against Private Police (SAPP) and the Hopkins Coalition Against ICE. Members of these groups attempted to deliver a letter to University President Ronald J. Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar at their offices on Wednesday, April 10. The letter asks to open negotiations between protestors and members of the administration. As Daniels and Kumar were not available at the time, the protesters gave Dean of Student Life Smita Ruzicka the letter. Sophomore Jeremy Berger, who has been participating in the sit-in, explained that it was important that the letter be delivered in person.

The University broadcasted its second virtual town hall on Sept. 29 at the School of Medicine’s campus in East Baltimore and its third fully virtual town hall on Sept. 30. The town halls were intended to garner community feedback on the draft of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Students and community members opposed to the JHPD interrupted proceedings at the town hall on Sept. 29. This followed the first town hall on Sept. 22, held at the Homewood campus, which was moved online after protestors staged a “Die-In“ at the in-person event. In an interview with The News-Letter, Vice President for Public Safety Branville Bard Jr. asserted that students and community members should accept the need for policing. “Policing is always going to be a necessary component of public safety,“ he said. “I would ask that everyone take up our collective energies and focus on

The JHU Dissenters and Refuel Our Future co-hosted a teach-in at Keyser Quad on Nov. 9 to educate attendees about the University’s involvement in war and climate change. Hopkins students gave speeches about issues related to the Applied Physics Lab (APL), the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD), fossil fuel investments, the University’s collaboration with the Space Force and Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC). The teach-in began with postdoctoral fellow Heidi Nicholls defining militarism. “Militarism is the perpetual state of war that we live in: how our lives are structured by war and war-making processes,” she said. “[JHU Dissenters] believe we already have everything we need to be safe. If we directed all these resources that Hopkins is pouring into militarism… to serve communities… then we could be living collectively a lot longer [and] better.” Nicholls pointed out that the U.S. is the number one global military spender.

The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) released a report earlier this month titled “Schools of Mass Destruction: American Universities in the U.S. Nuclear Weapons Complex.” The report identifies Hopkins as one of the universities involved in the development and maintenance of nuclear weapons in the U.S. ICAN is a consortium of non-governmental organizations across the globe that seek to ban the existence of nuclear weapons. The coalition was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017 for its work in promoting the United Nations nuclear weapons ban treaty. The main channel for the University’s involvement in defense research is the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), which holds contracts with many U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DOD) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Should the Hopkins APL continue nuclear weapons research? Nuclear weapons experts and students alike disagreed over the role that universities like Hopkins should

Hopkins affiliates and community members engaged in a series of events to protest against the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) on Nov. 29. The event started with a walk-out at 12:30 p.m., followed by a protest march from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. and ended with a vigil at 5 p.m at the Homewood Museum. The march took place around the Homewood campus, starting at Gilman Hall and ending at the Beach, with checkpoints at Homewood Field and Wyman Park. Attendees were also encouraged to join West Wednesday, a weekly demonstration fighting for accountability for Tyrone West and all victims of police brutality, at 6:30 p.m. at City Hall. During the walk-out, senior Jayla Scott shared some of their concerns regarding the impacts of the JHPD on the surrounding community. “When you police Hopkins students and staff for their safety, you’re also policing community members.

Jones read a poem that she wrote after West’s death.

Maureen Daly, the former president of AIA, discussed the organization’s decision making processes in an interview with The News-Letter. “There was a great deal of discussion at that meeting, and many different positions were presented,” she said. “When the University proposed [the plan for an armed police force], they expressed a perception that Baltimore is dangerous and that an armed police force would address that problem, but there was a strong feeling in the community that an armed private police force would not address community problems but might lead to greater violence and bigger problems.” Daly further emphasized that many surrounding

Last week, Senator Antonio Hayes introduced a new bill in the Maryland General Assembly: the Community Safety and Strengthening Act. This bill, SB 793, and its correspondent in the Maryland House of Representatives, HB 1094, includes the University’s second bid for a private police force. At first glance, this bill may seem promising; It proposes funding programs like the Children and Youth Fund, Mayor Catherine Pugh’s YouthWorks summer job programs and the Police Athletics League. These programs provide valuable opportunities for employment and career tracks in law enforcement for young people in our city. Powerful voices have spoken out in favor of the bill, including alumnus and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Maryland Senate President Mike Miller, U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings and Mayor Catherine Pugh.

On Monday, March 5 the University announced its intent to create a private police force. In the following week and a half, students created a petition against the proposal that has since garnered thousands of signatures; protested in front of University President Ronald J.

More than 200 students and demonstrators surrounded Homewood House (now known as Homewood Museum) in protest of military recruiting on campus on April 17, 1970. The protest occurred following the events on April 16, where 40 activists blocked the entrance to Levering Hall to protest the U.S. Marine Corps recruiters inside. University President Lincoln Gordon addressed protesters twice that day: once to promise a referendum and once to warn against a takeover. A court injunction limiting protest was issued on the same day, banning any meetings or speeches that would interfere with the normal operations of the University. Following the injunction, demonstrators began a weekend-long vigil near the library. Gordon promised to revoke the injunction if protesters agreed to his proposed referendum.

Teachers and Researchers United (TRU-UE) hosted a discussion panel entitled “Building Safe Communities without JHPD” on March 29. The event featured four panelists, comprised of both doctoral students and community members. Stephanie Saxton, a Political Science doctoral student at Hopkins, was the first speaker. To contextualize the claims and actions currently taken against the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD), Saxton provided a timeline of its development. In March 2018, Hopkins first announced the bill that would authorize the establishment of a University police force. According to Saxton, student organizers convened to discuss the announcement, which led to the creation of Students Against Private Police (SAPP). SAPP’s initial campaign targeted elected officials through lobbying, door-knocking, base-building and petitions, which successfully prevented the bill from passing legislation at the time. “This is an important part of the history.

Those who oppose the creation of a private police force, like freshman Jason Souvaliotis, saw the announcement as a victory. Souvaliotis is a member of Students Against Private Police (SAPP), a coalition of 11 student groups including Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Students for Environmental Action (SEA) and the Black Student Union (BSU). “I was so relieved and also really proud of the work that everyone did, glad that

Over the course of the past year, researchers have found that residents of low-income, majority-Black neighborhoods in Baltimore and cities across the country are at a higher risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19. For these neighborhoods in Baltimore, a common pattern emerges: They were almost all subjected to mid-20th century practices of housing segregation, including redlining and other racist policies. The history of redlining In the 1930s, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) instituted redlining, which denied investment in neighborhoods deemed high risk. The risk was generally based on race or ethnicity. Members of minority groups were unable to secure housing loans outside of specially designated neighborhoods, whereas wealthier, white residents moved elsewhere. Although racial discrimination in housing was banned in 1968, the impacts of these practices remain. The correlation between redlined neighborhoods and COVID-19 risk factors is merely one example of how these policies fueled pervasive inequities. The

A group of community activists and Hopkins students marched along York Road on July 11 to highlight racial disparities in North Baltimore. Demonstrators first gathered at the corner of York Road and Cold Spring Lane — a symbolic intersection, according to social worker Zachery Dingle, who ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for Maryland’s fourth congressional district. In an interview with The News-Letter, Dingle stated that he has observed inequity in Baltimore throughout his lifetime. “There is a clear disparity between the east and west sides of York Road. It was like this when I was a child, and it’s still like this today, he said. “This is typical of America — the haves versus the have-nots. At this time, we need to make an announcement that the have-nots have had enough.” The group marched from the crossroad to the Belvedere Square Market, where Heber Brown III, the senior pastor

Last spring, Hopkins Hospital paused its long-time practice of suing patients who could not afford their medical treatments. Activists have fought against the University’s aggressive medical debt collection tactics for years. As recently as last month, End Medical Debt Maryland hosted a rally to advocate for the Medical Debt Protection Act, which passed in this year’s Maryland General Assembly. The rally distributed information from ACLU of Maryland’s Know Your Rights program, detailing services and resources for individuals targeted by the Hospital. Because the University is a tax-exempt nonprofit, it is required by law to provide community benefits, such as offering medical services to those who demonstrate need for free or at a reduced cost. However, as highlighted in a 2019 report by National Nurses United (NNU) and the Coalition for a Humane Hopkins, many defendants were never informed about these resources. The report, titled “Taking Neighbors to Court: Johns Hopkins

Nurses from the Hopkins Hospital and National Nurses United (NNU), a union of registered nurses, joined local politicians and community members for a town hall event on Saturday at the Reginald F. Lewis Museum. Nurses from the Hospital gave a presentation called “Reputation vs. Reality,” arguing that the institution does not live up to its worldwide reputation. During the presentation, NNU revealed three investigative reports, which alleged that the Hospital was creating an unsafe environment for patients and nurses. The report highlighted understaffing of nurses, insufficient safety equipment and mandatory overtime as major issues. Nurses at the Hospital have been trying to unionize since early June. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) recently reported that the Hospital has violated federal law by enacting anti-union regulations, including banning nurses from communicating with workers in other units and coming in to work on their days off. The nurses, in conjunction with NNU,

The U.S. government classifies most colleges and universities as nonprofits because of their “educational purposes,” exempting them from federal income taxes. This means that, despite operating four campuses in Baltimore, Hopkins is not legally required to pay the city any property taxes. In 2016, Baltimore City entered into a 10-year Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) agreement with “anchor institutions,” whereby these institutions were required to pay the city a collective $60 million over the course of 10 years. The University, the Bayview Medical Center and Hopkins Hospital were all represented in this deal, with the University alone paying $1.8 million annually. However, in 2019, many Maryland-based organizations called for PILOT to be renegotiated, arguing that it is only a fraction of what Hopkins would be paying if it were a for-profit institution. In 2019, the University would have paid $26.6 million in property taxes if not for its exempt

End Medical Debt Maryland held a rally at the Hopkins Hospital Billings building on April 3 to protest against the practice of suing patients over medical debt. End Medical Debt Maryland is a coalition of 58 organizations that are advocating for the Medical Debt Protection Act to be passed at the Maryland General Assembly this spring. Numerous Baltimore residents shared their stories of financial and emotional distress incurred from the hardships of medical debt. The protesters also distributed “Know Your Rights” flyers around the neighborhood. Brig Dumais, coalition chair of End Medical Debt Maryland, emphasized that residents of East Baltimore are most likely to be sued for medical debt, notably Black people, single mothers and low-income essential workers. According to Dumais, at least 17% of Marylanders currently have medical debt in collections, with the median debt totaled around $944. “Ending medical debt is not only a patients’ rights issue. It’s

The Coalition for a Humane Hopkins (CAHH), which aims to hold Hopkins accountable to the communities it has harmed, held a protest on Sept. 15 against the University’s practice of suing patients over alleged medical debt. About 20 Hopkins affiliates and community members drove or biked through campus in protest. The caravan ended in Harriet Tubman Grove, where speakers criticized the University’s actions and praised community activism. Mihir Chaudhary, a physician at a Hopkins field hospital, criticized the School of Medicine for not living up to its mission statement, which includes improving health in both the community and the world. “We’re focusing for a second on one arm of Hopkins’ strategy of structural displacement and oppression: medical litigation,” Chaudhary said. Hopkins Hospital has used hardball tactics to sue thousands of its Black and low-income neighbors in East Baltimore — for a median amount of $1,089 in alleged medical debt, according

The pain and the horror of the whole process, of being relocated and displaced, of gentrified community — you can’t imagine the pain that goes through your mind.” These are the words of Donald Gresham, who is president of the Baltimore Redevelopment Action Coalition for Empowerment (BRACE), a nonprofit that aims to promote economic and racial equity in the city, particularly for the former and remaining residents of the Middle East neighborhood. Located near Hopkins Hospital, Middle East has been renamed Eager Park as part of East Baltimore Development Inc. (EBDI), the most drastic urban redevelopment initiative in recent American history, displacing about 800 predominantly Black and Brown families.

In the wake of the recent closure of the Save Middle East Action Committee (SMEAC), some residents in the Middle East Baltimore area that the organization served are embittered. But despite SMEAC's internal conflicts and its resulting disbandment, members of the community hope that a new organization can serve their interests. According to Donald Gresham, the former president of SMEAC, the organization closed because the "community's need has changed." SMEAC was created eight years ago to protect the interests and provide a voice for residents in Middle East Baltimore, the area affected by the redevelopment around the Hopkins Medical Institute. The organization often had a tense relationship with the East Baltimore Development Initiative (EBDI), the nonprofit partnership of parties invested in the project. University President Ronald Daniels serves on the EBDI board. While he did not directly address why the organization was disbanded, Gresham felt that "because of the limitations

Last Wednesday, Teachers and Researchers United (TRU-UE) held a discussion panel on potential alternatives to the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD). While this event was organized by the Hopkins graduate student union, faculty members also participated and expressed support for increased community dialogue surrounding the JHPD. If there’s one issue that has seemed to drive undergraduates, graduate students and faculty alike to use their voices, it’s the JHPD. In 2019, students and community members held a month-long sit-in in Garland Hall to protest the planned private police force and the University’s contracts with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Protesters even refused to leave Garland Hall after 80 Baltimore police officers arrived to vacate the building. Four students — two undergraduate and two graduate — were arrested. This past fall, the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Faculty Senate unanimously passed a resolution expressing its opposition to the JHPD, echoing many of

More than 600 faculty members signed a petition delivered to University President Ronald J. Daniels on June 5 calling for greater representation in University decision-making. The petition also demanded more financial transparency and the reversal of various austerity measures taken by the University, including hiring freezes and suspension of retirement plan contributions. The petition stemmed in part from History Professor François Furstenberg’s article “University Leaders Are Failing,” which was published in The Chronicle of Higher Education three weeks ago. Furstenberg argued that Hopkins administrators lead the University as a multinational corporation instead of an academic institution. By doing so, he wrote, administrators were unable to financially prepare for the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak and failed to fulfill the core academic mission of the University. In an interview with The News-Letter, Furstenberg described the current administrative organization at Hopkins as unsustainable. “We have a real lack of robust faculty

Refuel Our Future, the University’s student-run divestment organization, is starting Fossil Free Fridays, a weekly strike on Fridays going off of the national Fridays For Future (FFF) climate strike movement. Instead of protesting for climate justice and a Green New Deal, which is the basis of the fight for the youth FFF movement, Refuel will protest for fossil fuel divestment, a fight that the organization has been trying to win for a few years. Students want divestment from fossil fuels. Divestment means that Hopkins will no longer depend on fossil fuels in any way and will no longer invest in those companies as part of their endowment. The University’s endowment, which is worth $4.33 billion, allows the University to give scholarships and financial aid to their students. If it is steadily growing, it can help reduce annual tuition, which many people depend on in order to attend the University. Hopkins

For years, the task of managing the tenure process at Hopkins has been the responsibility of each individual campus. However, on Jan. 10, the Board of Trustees unanimously endorsed the proposal to create a Tenure Advisory Committee (TAC) to oversee tenure cases across all tenure-granting schools within the university. Promising job stability, academic recognition and a consistent salary, tenure originally became popular at universities in the U.S. during the 1940s. In an interview with The News-Letter, Professor Derek Schilling, member of the Executive Committee of the Johns Hopkins chapter of the American Association of University Professors, explained that today, tenure is regarded as protection for academic freedom, and by extension, freedom of speech. “The most important aspect of tenure is that it does ensure that the tenured scholar can pursue any number of questions — even controversial questions — without the fear of being sanctioned by the University administration,” Schilling

The Critical Diaspora Studies (CDS) initiative was created to diversify the undergraduate student experience at Hopkins through the creation of a new interdisciplinary academic space.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, Asian Americans have been subject to physical and verbal attacks. The recent rise in hate crimes has raised further alarm in Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) communities nationwide. On Tuesday, eight people, six of whom were Asian, were shot in spas near Atlanta. Following these shootings, University President Ronald J. Daniels released a statement on March 18 condemning violent acts of racism. This statement came after many members of the University’s APIDA community called for increased support from the administration. Co-President Georgie D’Sanson of the Filipino Students Association described the statement as insufficient. “It seems like the statement was aimed more toward people who aren’t part of the APIDA community, the way it’s worded,” she said. “It didn’t feel personal.” In his email, Daniels promised University support of its APIDA community. “We are committed to providing the support that will allow our Asian

Following a rise in xenophobia against Asian Americans at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a recent string of high-profile attacks in the past few months that raised greater awareness of violence against the Asian American community. Victims faced unprovoked punching, violent shoving and slashing with weapons. Many attacks — which targeted different members of Asian communities, including Chinese, Thai, Filipino and Vietnamese people — have been captured on surveillance camera and shared widely on social media. Some attacks have led to hate crime charges.

Johns Hopkins University Dissenters organized “Candlelight Vigil for a Free Palestine” on Oct. 23. Students gathered at the beach to mourn the Palestinian lives lost in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The current Israeli-Hamas war began on Oct. 7 when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel; in response, Israel declared war on Hamas.

The walkout voiced demands to the University administration and included speeches from Hopkins community members. Dissenters presented four demands to the University administration. First, they called on the University to divest from weapons manufacturers, like Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. Then, they demanded the University to publicly call for an immediate ceasefire, an end to Israel’s siege on Gaza and an end to U.S. military aid to Israel. They also called for the University to publicly condemn Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism, as well as hold individuals accountable for racist actions. Lastly, they asked the University to provide dedicated mental health resources to Palestinians and all groups affected by the ongoing conflict.

The Coalition for Advocacy for Non-Tenure Track Faculty Equity (CANE) wrote a letter on Jan. 12 calling for the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (Bloomberg School) Office of the Dean to address the increasing salary inequity between tenure track (TT) and non-tenure track (NTT) faculty salaries. At the time of this article, 224 Bloomberg School faculty members have added their signatures. According to the letter, tenure and non-tenure track Bloomberg School faculty both received a letter in July 2023 informing them that they would receive a pay increase, with tenured faculty receiving higher pay than non-tenured faculty by 8%. The coalition claims that, in December 2023, tenured faculty again received a higher salary increase. Although the exact percentage difference in December is uncertain, CANE estimates that the pay gap between tenured and

The administration sent a broadcast email to the student body announcing a draft of the University’s second strategic framework, Ten for One, on April 14. The framework outlines 10 goals that the University hopes to achieve by 2030. The goals focus on building an inclusive, University-wide community on-campus; promoting excellence in students, faculty and staff; continuing to lead in research endeavours with real world impacts; and contributing to neighboring Baltimore communities. Ten for One follows Ten by Twenty, the first University-wide strategic framework published in 2013. The new strategy retains the goals from the previous framework to build one University, individual excellence and commitment to our neighboring community. In an email to The News-Letter, President Ronald J. Daniels reflected on the goals of the strategic framework.

On Jan. 18, University President Ronald J. Daniels announced in The Atlantic that the University has not considered legacy status as a factor in admissions since 2014. With this move, Hopkins joined the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, the University of California system and several other institutions of higher education that do not consider legacy affiliation when evaluating admissions applications. Vice Provost for Admissions and Financial Aid David Phillips explained in an interview with The News-Letter that ending the legacy admissions program was part of a broader initiative to diversify the incoming classes of the University. “We have a higher proportion of students who are the first in their family to attend college,” he said. “Across the board, we have more diverse classes now than we did 10 years ago.” Phillips explained that applicants are still asked for their parents’ alma maters for statistical purposes.

“Unfortunately, I cannot say that during my time at Hopkins I have felt supported as a [First-Generation, Limited-Income (FLI)] student by the University as a whole. Over time, the University has started to recognize the struggles that FLI students face, but it has been a slow process to correct these issues.” These are the words of senior Felicia Petterway, student representative of the FLI Network. Launched during the summer of 2018, the Network is comprised of students, staff and faculty. Its purpose is to promote solidarity and belonging among students who are from low-income families or who are the first in their family to attend college. The Network will host National First-Generation College Student Day this Friday, Nov 8.

The Second Commission on Undergraduate Education (CUE2) released its final report on Nov. 20. The report made a wide array of recommendations to improve the undergraduate experience at Hopkins, including replacing the distribution requirements to obtain a degree. CUE2 was formed in 2017 to promote interdisciplinary learning and mental health on campus. Co-chaired by Whiting School of Engineering (WSE) Dean Ed Schlesinger and former Krieger School of Arts and Sciences (KSAS) Dean Beverly Wendland, CUE2 is made up of 30 faculty, staff, administrators, undergraduates and alumni. Since its creation, CUE2 has released draft plans and held town halls to collect community input on its recommendations. In email to The News-Letter, Student Government Association Junior Class President Nathan Mudrak stated that CUE2 successfully took student voices into consideration. “My confidence in the report is especially gained by the comprehensive and thorough approach the commission took to garnering student feedback,” he wrote.

The Second Commission on Undergraduate Education (CUE2) released a set of recommendations last month, intended to revitalize the undergraduate experience and promote mental health on campus. Co-chaired by Krieger School of Arts and Sciences (KSAS) Dean Beverly Wendland and Whiting School of Engineering (WSE) Dean Ed Schlesinger, CUE2 is comprised of 30 faculty, staff, administrators, undergraduates and alumni. On Thursday Feb. 27, CUE2 held its first town hall discussion in Levering Hall with Hopkins community members in order to receive feedback on the draft report. CUE2, convened by President Ronald J.

These changes include a mandatory first-year seminar and the establishment of a “Hopkins semester” of intensive study.

Christopher Celenza has been designated as the next James B. Knapp Dean of the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences (KSAS). According to a University-wide email sent on Oct. 22 by University President Ronald J. Daniels, Celenza will begin his tenure on Jan. 4, 2021.

The University launched Realizing Our Promise: The Second JHU Roadmap on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion with a virtual kickoff event on March 11, bringing several speakers to discuss the goals and initiatives of the Roadmap. This Roadmap is the second stage of the University's mission to incorporate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) into the core framework of the institution. The second Roadmap was designed to address the strengths and shortcomings of the first Roadmap, launched in 2016, and the recommendations of the Roadmap 2020 Task Force. At the event, University President Ronald J. Daniels recalled the influence of the first Roadmap on the institution. “We have laid a critical foundation for public accountability and radical transparency through a regular report on staff, faculty and graduate student diversity numbers across our divisions,” he said.

University leaders held a virtual town hall on Sept. 18 to inform students about updates to the Roadmap on Diversity and Inclusion and the Roadmap 2020 Task Force. The Roadmap was originally published in the fall of 2016 with the intention of fostering greater diversity within the University’s faculty, students, staff, climate and greater community. At the town hall, Provost Sunil Kumar noted that the University has made significant strides toward diversity and inclusion since 2016, including ending legacy admissions and changing hiring processes. “We have seen real and measurable progress... but by no means should you mistake what I’m saying as a victory lap,” he said. “There’s still a lot more to be done, and structural change requires consistent, persistent and deliberate efforts from hundreds of people across the institution.” According to Kumar, under the Roadmap, faculty, undergraduate and graduate diversity have increased.

Historically, Hopkins has maintained a complex relationship with owning land and property in Baltimore. The University is the largest tax-exempt property owner in Baltimore and makes a significant economic contribution to the city. With $2.64 billion worth of properties, Johns Hopkins University & Medicine has an economic impact of more than $7.3 billion on the city, according to Assistant Vice President for Media Relations and News J.B.

The list of properties encompasses a wide range of neighborhoods, including Mount Vernon, Middle East, Charles Village, Waverly and Bayview. Behind the University’s impressive track record of properties, however, are decades of redlining, gentrification and forced displacement.

Hopkins announced its purchase of the Dell House Apartments and the former Seaton High School this week in order to provide additional staff parking and office space. "The reason we purchased this 2.3 acre property was that it is close to the Homewood campus and was available at the right price," said James T.

Struever Bros. Eccles & Rouse, Inc. (SBE&R), the Baltimore-based real estate development company in charge of the project, created the Charles Village Task Force in February.

In January 2004, residents of the East Baltimore area were informed through an article published in the Baltimore Sun -- rather than by the city of Baltimore itself -- that their homes would be acquired and demolished by the city for the development of the East Baltimore Biotechnical Project, which will provide Hopkins with laboratory space in the development's biotechnical and life sciences buildings.

While we acknowledge that the relocation of Hopkins' humanities departments to the Dell House during Gilman's renovation is necessary, we find the University's treatment of Dell House residents upsetting. The departments' move to a centralized space is essential to maintaining the interdisciplinary interaction that defines the humanities at Hopkins. Unfortunately, the only viable option was the Dell House, an apartment building already occupied. The alternative, trailers scattered across campus, would be wholly unacceptable. The Dell House, while relatively far from the center of the Homewood campus, will nevertheless provide a space in which the humanities departments will be able to operate. We are disturbed, rather, by the manner in which the University has dealt with current Dell House residents. While the administration has been aware of the planned move since the spring, many Dell House residents remained completely ignorant of the pending relocation until a report in the News-Letter last

The Dell House has become the new location for a myriad of departments due to the renovation of the iconic building that used to house them, Gilman Hall. The transition however, has faced several difficulties. One of the biggest concerns of the faculty within the Dell House, located between 28th and 29th Street on North Charles, has been the lack of office space. "The offices are much smaller than the Gilman offices. Faculty have had to put most of their books and papers in storage, or they have moved them to their homes. The department of history office is woefully cramped," History professor Judith Walkowitz said. This problem is aggravated by the fact that there are more faculty members than there are offices. "Three people are sharing an office that is smaller than my Gilman Hall office," History professor Franklin Knight said. "Shared office space means that individual faculty members

;Eddie's Market, a Charles Village staple, closes after 58 years of service - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By ARIELLA SHUA                                                     | January 31, 2021
After decades of serving the neighborhood, Eddie’s Market of Charles Village closed its doors on Dec. 30, 2020. The location was sold to MCB Real Estate, who has yet to announce its plans for the lot going forward. The grocery, known for its deli and local brands, was a small store on St. Paul Street. Eddie’s had a close relationship with both the Hopkins community and Charles Village residents. Jerry Gordon, 73, has owned the store since 1980 and has worked at Eddie’s franchises since he was 15 years old. In an interview with The News-Letter, he explained that he chose to retire in order to spend more time with his family. “I’ve gotten mixed reactions from customers,” he said. “Some sad, some happy for me. ‘We’ll miss you,’ obviously. It’s been bittersweet, for me and for them.” Many in the Hopkins community were shocked and saddened by the news.

After approximately four years of owning the Olmstead lot, the barren plot of land between St. Paul and Charles on 33rd Street, Hopkins is beginning to discuss potential plans for the lot’s future development. Purchased by Hopkins back in 2008 for $12.5 million, the development of the property is finally beginning to take off. Hopkins hired Sasaki Associates Inc., a firm based in Boston specializing in interdisciplinary planning and design, to complete a study examining several questions related to student life and students’ needs. Alan Fish, the Vice President for Real Estate and Campus Services, described the development delay as a result of challenging economic times. Fish credited University President Ron Daniels, with prompting the fruition of the St. Paul’s Street lot’s development. “The real driver of this is President Daniels. He has made it a real priority to want to use Johns Hopkins as an anchor institution here in

By Lauren Fang Staff Writer Since its ground-breaking ceremony last March, the 3200 St. Paul construction has evolved into a structural foundation with a first deck under the governance of Armada Hoffler and Beatty Development. “We started from the ground up with the footers and the foundation of the building,” said Darnell Sample, a laborer for Facchina, a concrete company that works alongside Hirsch electricians and Maamech plumbers and mechanics on-site. “Now we’re on the first deck, the second level.” The project is expected to house 31,500 square-feet of commercial space, including a CVS pharmacy. Parking for tenants and the public will also be available. According to Vice Provost for Student Affairs Kevin G. Shollenberger, the project’s goal is to provide upperclassmen with additional housing while continuing to vitalize Charles Village. “This project is also the kickoff for a new Charles Village retail, transportation and streetscape planning process,” Shollenberger said.

Hopkins Athletic Director Jennifer S. Baker announced in a press release on Tuesday that the men’s lacrosse head coach, Dave Pietramala, will not be returning next season after 20 years of service to the program. The news comes as a shock to many, given Pietramala’s rich history at Hopkins. A former player for the Hopkins program, Pietramala won the William C. Schmeisser Award as the top defenseman in the nation twice and the Lt. Raymond Enners Award for most outstanding player. In addition, Pietramala was named a first-team All-American three times during his career and was a part of the 1987 National Championship team. Pietramala matched one of the most decorated lacrosse playing careers by becoming the program’s all-time winningest coach. Pietramala bounced around several institutions serving various roles, from assistant coach to defensive coordinator, before finally returning to his alma mater in 2000. After 20 seasons, Pietramala amassed a

It’s Saturday morning. You step outside your building hungover, 15 minutes late, organic tote bag in hand. You spy two figures waiting for you. One of them sports fading blue hair. Clearly, she’s not like other girls (newsflash: she is). The other figure wears a neck gaiter (okay Miss Rona) and oversized sunglasses. She could literally be anybody. You begin to walk. Within mere seconds, you spy your ex across the street and make eye contact. You walk another block. You spot a Tinder match and avert your gaze. You walk two more blocks.

Following Eddie’s Market of Charles Village’s closure in December 2020, Streets Market filled its vacancy on St. Paul Street. Streets opened for business in June of this year. Jesamine Lee, brand manager of Streets, explained in an interview with The News-Letter that she hopes the grocery store will be able to carry on Eddie’s tradition of close relationships with students and residents alike. She explained that the store prioritizes product, price and service. “We’ve definitely been more diverse in terms of our grocery options,” she said. “There is a strong international community at Hopkins so we really focus on Asian grocery products and the basics of college life like instant ramen.

The Tortured Poets Department, Taylor Swift’s new studio album, came out on Friday with 16 brand-new shiny songs, and then, two hours after its release, Swift announced 15 more songs as part of The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology. In this album, the highs are average and the lows are low. With the repetitive pop-synth production in the first half of the album and the recycling of the same melodies in the second half, as you listen, the album starts to lose its path.

I studied abroad in Paris last spring and it still comes up frequently. Naturally, when people learn that I studied abroad, they ask me about it. Not wanting to kill the mood, I usually find myself lying, or, at least, oversimplifying the situation. Typically I’ll admit that I didn’t love Paris, but that I appreciated the chance to travel and my great trip to Poland. I’ll say I made friends from other colleges that I’m still in touch with, and I’m lucky to have them in my life. I won’t say that I regretted going, much less explain why. In Paris, I was consumed by compounding feelings of grief and isolation following the death of my 21-year-old cousin, Thomas. I’ve written previously about dealing with homesickness in Paris and about making lists last summer, once I returned to the U.S., to get more in touch with my emotions, grief included.

There’s a sick dichotomy between Sept. 2, 2021 being my 19th birthday and Sept. 2, 2021 being the day my 20-year-old cousin, Thomas, was diagnosed with leukemia. There is also something nauseating about my use of the word “sick” when that is exactly what he is — trapped in the hospital undergoing chemotherapy when just weeks ago everything was perfectly normal, save for his toothache with an unknown cause. He is also, at present, nauseous, so I suppose I shouldn’t have used that word either. I am lucky. I have never experienced true loss. My first experience with death occurred when I was 5 years old, when my dog died and I point-blank asked my mother if I could see his skull. The only wakes I’ve attended have been for distant relatives — the service delivered entirely in Korean for my father’s uncle and the wake for my mother’s great

I have known three homes of my paternal grandparents: the Old Westbury house on Bacon Road — the one that my cousins say has since been painted to look like a Taco Bell — the Asharoken house on the north shore of Long Island and now, and finally, the one in Northport with the house number that always manages to slip my mind. Most of my favorite memories have the Asharoken home as their backdrop: the games of sardines where I hid in cramped closets, singing “This Land is Your Land” with my cousins on one of their visits to New York from California and, most notably, the walks on the beach every time my grandparents hosted a gathering. We always did this, especially on Thanksgiving. No one ever dressed quite warm enough to combat the outdoors, much less November’s chill when it worked in conjunction with the sea breeze

One of my goals for my semester abroad was to take a solo trip. I wasn’t sure where I wanted to go, but I knew that the experience would be crucial to learning more about myself. After sitting on the idea for some time, I decided to go to Kraków, Poland for a few reasons. First, I have Polish heritage on my mother’s side. I grew up eating some Polish foods prepared by my grandmother: pierogi, babka and kołaczki, to name a few examples, and I was very intrigued by the possibility of having Polish dishes in Poland. Though I was most familiar with the country’s culture in terms of food, I was also interested in the nation’s history and nature, making the trip very appealing. I ultimately decided between Warsaw and Kraków and booked a four-night stay in Kraków due to the wide array of attractions available as well

Even as a senior at Hopkins, I haven’t exactly mastered control over my own homesickness. Initially, this lack of proficiency was a product of not experiencing much homesickness early on in my time at Hopkins. More recently, during my semester abroad in Paris, I was overwhelmed by how isolated I felt. It’s likely that no one is completely in control of their homesickness, but over the years, I have found a few effective strategies to mitigate dwelling on it. Talk on the go I have made a habit of calling friends and family whenever I am doing basic tasks. I tend to call someone whenever I am folding laundry, walking to class, cooking or performing any other simple activity. As I recognize that I exhibit more extroverted tendencies than most others, I have found that this strategy saves me from having to specifically carve out time to keep in touch

Going into this summer, I knew it wouldn’t be about writing, but I told myself it would be — as if saying it could make it true. Honestly, I had hardly written in the winter and spring of 2023. At first, it was because I was busy adjusting to my life in a foreign country. As winter faded into spring, it was because I was grieving the loss of my cousin to leukemia. I had wanted to write about Paris, but I instead found myself blaming Paris for my misery, though it was merely the setting. I had this big idea about how I could write an incredible poem in my cousin’s honor, but I couldn’t do it. I still want to write that poem, but I still haven’t found the right words.

Prior to the semester, organizers perform benchmark assessments to evaluate each child’s skills and weaknesses in reading and math.

The Tutorial Project has been serving the Baltimore community for 63 years by offering free after-school tutoring to elementary school students. The project is back in person this semester, but with one crucial difference: The program no longer has a bus service to transport students from their schools to the Homewood Campus. The program typically provides tutoring to approximately 120 children from Baltimore City public and charter elementary schools each year. This year the program has seen a decline in enrollment and more sporadic attendance due to the lack of reliable transportation. The Baltimore City Public School System’s underfunding creates barriers to student achievement. The poor conditions at many schools and lack of resources in the district pose challenges for parents, teachers and students alike, contributing to educational inequity.

At a packed Baltimore City Public Schools (BCPS) board meeting on Tuesday, hundreds of parents, teachers and students gathered to voice their outrage over heating problems that have affected classrooms since schools returned for the new year. Last week, about 60 BCPS closed after heating problems brought temperatures in the classrooms down to near-freezing levels. In the first week of January, the city saw unusually cold temperatures dropping into the single digits. Many of the schools were closed on Friday due to burst pipes and broken heating systems. Students bundled up in layers of coats and hats in order to stay warm in their classrooms. One attendee yelled to the board members that they were out of touch with what the families of Baltimore children were experiencing. “If your child was in school, if your child was that cold, what would you have done?” she said. “You don’t know how

91 felony counts. $355 million in civil fraud. Four indictments. But what does it all matter? Donald Trump’s legal woes have become something of a spectacle, with a new case or arraignment seemingly arriving every week. However, it seems that these felonies are having practically no impact on his presidential ambitions. In recent polls against incumbent President Joe Biden, Trump leads, and his approval ratings are also above the sitting president. This begs the question: Why do people not seem to care about Trump’s felonies, and which of his indictments, if any, may sway popular opinion? First off, let’s examine Trump’s four indictments. Although he faces dozens of other counts of felonies, these cases are the most serious and most likely to return verdicts before the presidential election in November. The first case revolved around hush money payments to an adult film star in 2016 with a charge of falsifying

While the patriarchy is certainly still strong in Western countries like the U.S., it is a different beast in South Korea. Among all countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), South Korea is at the bottom in gender income disparity rankings, with a whopping 31% difference in pay between men and women, despite its high GDP and standing as a developed country. Additionally, there has been a strong wave of anti-feminist movements across the country, boosted by the election of the conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol. Yoon claimed that structural gender discrimination no longer exists and promised to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. However, according to a 2021 survey, 1 in 3 Korean women have experienced some sort of gender-based violence, and their perpetrators were most likely current or former romantic partners, with most of these cases going unpunished or unresolved.

Okay, you get to the next level, and then you get to the last level and then what? You just play it all over again? Never mind the fact that I didn’t particularly enjoy games that hurt people violently. Games on the Wii were more tolerable, but then whenever I’d win (or more likely, lose), I’d think, “What’s next?” I held this mindset until I walked into my cousins’ bedroom while I was visiting them for Christmas and saw them playing a computer game.

The 2024 Spring Fair Concert at Hopkins, featuring singer-rapper Flo Milli, was electrifying. The initial announcement of her as the main Spring Fair Concert artist sparked some unhappy discourse among students, but those who attended the event went home exhilarated by an extremely fun performance. As students filtered in and found their place in the crowd, DJ Flow was hyping everyone up and taking song requests through Instagram DMs. He did a good job catering to the audience. I’ve never seen a group of people get so hyped up from a warm-up DJ, but it turns out all it takes is “Surround Sound” and “Gasolina” to get the Hopkins student body rolling. Electronic dance music trio Cheat Codes had a killer opening set, with some really cool drops, energizing the crowd. They repeatedly shouted out the center of the crowd who had their hands in the air the whole performance.

On April 8, the University announced Meek Mill as the headliner for this year’s Spring Fair concert, which will take place on April 30 in the Ralph S. O’Connor Recreation Center. The event capacity is 1,800 and tickets are currently sold out. The 2022 Spring Fair is being planned by the Office of Leadership Engagement and Experiential Development (LEED) with the aid of chosen representatives from the Graduate Representative Organization, Peabody Institute, Student Government Association (SGA) and the Hopkins Students Organization for Programming (HOP) along with other campus sponsors. This will mark the second year that University administrators are in charge of the event. The Philadelphia-based rapper has released five studio albums that have become commercial successes, and founded his record label Dream Chasers Records in 2011. After facing legal issues and serving five months in a state correctional facility, Mill began to advocate for criminal justice, founding REFORM Alliance

Spring Fair 2021, which included virtual, hybrid and in-person events, was held Friday, April 23 through Sunday, April 25. In addition to pandemic-related changes, University administrators, rather than students, planned Spring Fair this year. They organized the weekend with input from the student body via groups such as the Hopkins Organization for Programming (HOP) and Hoptoberfest. This change was in response to last year’s controversy surrounding the Spring Fair Planning Committee’s misconduct allegations, which included hazing and underage drinking. The University fired several committee members, and others quit due to the changes. Director of JHUnions and Activities Hal Turner described this year’s Spring Fair planning process in an email to The News-Letter. “In order to gain as much student input as possible, the Spring Fair Planning Committee created an idea-share survey that was sent to Hopkins students and [Registered Student Organization] leaders requesting input on the types of activities and

Editor’s Note, 2024: This article was sent to The News-Letter for publication as an op-ed and completed the editing process prior to being posted elsewhere. To the Members of the Johns Hopkins Community, On Monday, April 29, the Beach became the site of a Palestine Solidarity Encampment, one of many on campuses across the nation. The encampment concerns many Hopkins students — the Jewish community included. The horrific attacks against Israel on Oct. 7 impacted us directly, with members of our community losing friends and family members. In the months since, we have mourned the loss of civilian lives — Israeli and Palestinian. We recognize the disheartening and disturbing conditions in Gaza. At the same time, we stand firm against Hamas — a terrorist organization committed to the destruction of the Jewish people. While the Hopkins Jewish community possesses a variety of opinions regarding the Israel-Hamas war, we are committed

For over three weeks, members of the Hopkins and Baltimore community have participated in a sit-in at Garland Hall to protest the proposed private police force and the University’s contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The protest was organized by Students Against Private Police (SAPP) and the Hopkins Coalition Against ICE (HCAI). As the sit-in continues, protesters are working to ensure that their platform centers marginalized voices. Mariam Banahi, a graduate student in the Department of Anthropology, explained that one goal the protesters have is to ensure that voices that are usually silenced are given a platform. Banahi stated that protesters reached out to Goldsmiths Anti-Racist Action, a group occupying a building at Goldsmiths, University of London to protest racism, for insight into how to make the sit-in more inclusive. “We’ve been in contact with the anti-racism occupation at Goldsmiths, and they’ve provided some necessary guidance on how

It’s a rare sight to see Hopkins students so enthused by the arts. Theater gains attention mostly by faculty and alumni, and while the University’s plethora of acapella groups offer a great artistic community, their shows are scattered and inconsistent. One might even point to the Spring Fair Concert as evidence for a perceived interest in the arts by the student body, but as far as student performances go, there is only one main event which seems to receive broad interest across all demographics: the “Spring Show,” organized by WJHU Radio. We’re all lucky the Spring Show even happened this year. My friends and I went to the Beach to check it out at the planned time — 12:30 p.m., April 27 — even though it was raining, mainly because the promotional material stated quite boldly: “rain or shine.” Even the slight drizzle was apparently enough to stop the show,

If one thing is certain when it comes to the arts community at Hopkins, it is each artist’s individual passion. Whether it’s the many theater groups, orchestras or underground coalitions of rock-loving musicians, the arts of our lady Homewood are alive and well. But is this hidden culture that courses through the student body recognized as much as it should be? One perfect example of this sometimes-hidden culture is The Bohs, a newly formed rock group made up of sophomores and seniors alike. I had the pleasure of interviewing the group as they rehearsed their performance for the student group showcase during Spring Fair. My first exposure to The Bohs came just this past weekend at Alpha Epsilon Pi’s Hopstock event, a party full of ‘60s love and hippie energy. The Bohs were the closing performance, playing songs like Fleetwood Mac’s “Chain” and Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Fortunate Son.” It was

When Julien Fenouil wanted to join the student radio station as a freshman in 2018, an upperclassman told him it wasn’t worth it. WJHU radio was dying, and Fenouil was busy adjusting to college life, so he put it off. The following year, the club had only one active member. Fenouil explained how he and his friend Amanda Fernandes crafted a plan last year to revive WJHU radio in an interview with The News-Letter. “We became presidents and used last year to bring the club back, to do events on campus like the spring show during Spring Fair, get a base of shows going, get people in the room again and get the club's name out there again,” he said. This year’s Co-Presidents Jasper Adams and Biz Stahl are running with the same momentum and have their sights set high. Both expressed gratitude to their predecessors in an interview with

The University held its 52nd Annual Spring Fair from April 27 to April 30. This year’s Spring Fair, following the precedent set by the previous two years, was planned by the Office of Leadership Engagement and Experiential Development (LEED) in collaboration with Hopkins Student Organization for Programming (HOP). The Spring Fair commenced with the Culture Show on Thursday, which showcased 12 different student groups. Following the show, students gathered in front of the Beach to watch the fireworks, while others watched from the comfort of their homes. In an interview with The News-Letter, senior Anthony Garcia described his experience watching the fireworks with his friends on the rooftop of his apartment. “All of us went up there to see it and it was a perfect view all the way down to the harbor. You can see the fireworks perfectly from there,” he said. “It was good fun and chill vibes

The first night of Culture Show has always been one of my favorite days of the semester. As the semester winds down, that familiar, heady mix of exam stress, despair and sleep deprivation begins to set in. And yet, the Culture Show never fails to make me forget all of that. For two electric hours, I’m completely absorbed in seeing what all the incredible cultural groups on campus have spent the semester preparing, learning about different styles of music and dance and being humbled by Hopkins students’ commitment to carrying tradition forward into our campus today. As I took my seat in Shriver Hall, I was amazed at how many people were there on a Thursday night on the last week of classes. It was more students than I’d ever seen in Shriver Hall before, and the crowd was buzzing. Presented by the Office of Multicultural Affairs, the theme for

In March 2020, COVID-19 forced us to switch to daily, online-only production. Yet for the nearly 125 years before the pandemic, The News-Letter was a print (or a print-first) publication. The oldest paper in the Sheridan Libraries archive is our Oct. 14, 1897 issue. Back then, the paper was published every other week and cost 15 cents per copy or $1.50 for a yearly subscription. Some of the articles include a lecture at the School of Medicine and a piece about the institution of a College Congress at Hopkins. COURTESY OF THE UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES — SHERIDAN LIBRARIES This was just the fifth issue of the paper and the first of the paper’s second volume. Since then, beyond adding more staff and new sections like Opinions and Leisure, we’ve fundamentally reworked the look and goals of the paper and gone online.

Howard Dean is hunched down in the passenger seat of his white minivan, talking on his cell phone. It's 11:15 a.m. on a Monday morning in Baltimore and the Democratic presidential candidate is waiting to come out to a small rally organized for his one and only campaign stop in Charm City. Approximately 200 supporters have been trickling in since 10:15 a.m. on this foggy morning, carrying royal blue signs and homemade banners. "IN BAWLMER, WE BLIEVE IN DEAN," [sic] one sign reads. Here in Baltimore, like in the rest of America, Dean is running on a slogan of "Take our country back" and recent polls suggest strong support for the former governor from Vermont in the Democratic primary race. While the crowd stands in a quiet huddle, a news ticker on a nearby building flashes: "Dean leads 44 percent to Kerry 23 percent in New Hampshire Poll." As one

Those of us who choose the non-Greek path of the undergraduate social scene only see the culmination of the fraternity party process, the celebration itself. But after speaking to members from different fraternities on campus, one learns that the few hours you spend at their house on a weekend night actually represents only a fraction of the time that is put into the event. It must be planned, advertised, and when the big night comes, such a gathering must be orchestrated to ensure the safety and satisfaction of those in attendance. However, learning about the planning process of the average fraternity gala at Johns Hopkins leaves one with an unanswered query; included in all that must be done, can separate the average Greek celebration from a great fraternity party?

A $30 million superstructure. An extension to the Milton S. Eisenhower Library (MSEL). A place where students will be able to hang out and study. These were only some of the descriptions Winston Tabb, the Sheridan Dean of University Libraries and Museums, used to detail what the swanky new Brody Learning Commons (BLC) would look like. The BLC is still under construction, and is projected to be finished next summer. The Brody Learning Commons was conceived in order to give students what they couldn’t get from the MSEL. “In the process of gaining feedback of what the students wanted in the BLC that the MSEL lacked, we noticed a common grievance,” Tabb said. “The MSEL was a bunker of sorts, where students felt a lack of natural light. In the course of designing the BLC, we saw this as our top priority. We made sure that students will have plenty

There has really been only one thing in the news this week. I am referring of course to the successful raid by Navy SEALs of a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, culminating in the death of Osama Bin Laden. On May 1st, the FBI’s most wanted terrorist was finally killed nearly 10 years after he masterminded the 9/11 tragedy and after 30 years of violent jihadist terrorism. That day was coincidently my birthday and the news definitely added an extra bit of cheer to my day, as it did to most Americans and justice loving people the world over. Bin Laden’s death is the crowning achievement of America’s ongoing War on Terror and has been handled successfully by the White House. Everything about the whole operation has showed me how America has adapted to the type of irregular warfare that has proved troublesome for quite some time.From the planning to the

Late Sunday night, after President Obama announced that a Specil Forces Team had located and killed Osama Bin Laden, spontaneous celebrations erupted across the country, including on the Homewood campus and in Charles Village. Some students even went to Washington D.C. to join the revelry that broke out around the White House. However, this reaction to Bin Laden’s death was highly controversial. Some students, like senior Tyler Smith, thought the revelry was in poor taste. “Whether or not one believes that killing Bin Laden was morally justified, a death is never cause for celebration. His death is cause for solemn reflection on everything we lost on September 11, and have lost since.” Smith said. Other students, like senior Aaron Jones, found nothing wrong with the positive response. “I think when evil people die it’s a good thing and too many good people die on this planet for me to mourn

Some time in the last week, a new Facebook group Johns Hopkins Memes went viral on the newsfeeds of many Hopkins students. The emergence of the new group is part of a larger Facebook trend: college students across the nation are creating "meme pages" to spread information about their school to others who attend. Some might be asking, "what exactly is a meme?" A meme, pronounced "meem" and not "me-may" or "may-may," is simply a means of spreading any sort of information through the internet. Some of the most popular memes are accompanied by pictures — sometimes a cat or cute puppy, a character from a movie, a famous celebrity or even an ordinary person. Some of the most popular memes on the internet include "lolcats," "rickrolling," "it's over 9000!," "this is SPARTA!," "good guy Greg" and "socially awkward penguin."

Yeah, I don't even know what this means. I think I cried when I heard this quote because it was so entirely bizarre. Do you bite your siblings? I have one older sister and I can tell you for a fact that I have never ever had the desire to bite her. I don't know about you, but I generally reserve the act of biting for things that are dead and processed like steamed broccoli or writing utensils. Biting is such a primal behavior. In the animal kingdom, biting can signify aggression, affection, hunger, boredom, communication, frustration....yeah, a lot of emotions. My dog used to bite the wooden legs of our piano when her teeth were growing in. That emotion is called "teething", Human babies could probably empathize.

Members of the U.S. Secret Service gathered in an undisclosed location in Laurel, MD this week for a two-day ethics training course conducted by professors and administrators from the Hopkins School of Education. The semi-covert session came two and a half weeks after twelve Secret Service agents allegedly solicited prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia, where President Barack Obama had traveled to attend the sixth Summit of the Americas. The ensuing controversy has made headlines across the country and prompted official inquiries into the Secret Service agency; University officials, however, said that the ethics forum was always scheduled to take place and is not remedial. “We had this course planned long before the Cartagena issue,” Christopher Dreisbach, who heads the School of Education’s Department of Applied Ethics and Humanities for the Division of Public Safety Leadership, said.

Baltimore residents took to the streets this past week to protest the death of Freddie Gray, who died on April 19 from a spinal cord injury after his arrest a week earlier. While the protests have largely remained peaceful, pockets of violence erupted on Saturday evening, and by Monday night, riots caused the University to order students on Homewood Campus to remain indoors. In an email to the University community Tuesday night, President Ronald J. Daniels condemned the violence as inexcusable and joined those across the city who are seeking answers to the circumstances surrounding Gray’s death. “We join those who are endorsing the urgency of a full and independent investigation of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Gray’s death,” he wrote. “It is essential that all of our city’s citizens have trust and confidence in professional and fair treatment by our police.” Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency and

Hopkins students called for justice for Freddie Gray at a student-led protest on Wednesday afternoon. The group gathered in front of the Beach and walked down N. Charles Street to Penn Station, where they joined other college and high school students from across the city. The Homewood protest was organized by the Black Student Union (BSU) and Hopkins Feminists. Protesters held up posters that said “Hopkins Cares” and “Am I Next?” and chanting, “All night, all day, we will fight for Freddie Gray.” Many of the students wore shirts that said “Black Lives Matter,” and many others wore black clothing. Students marched from the Beach to Gilman Hall and protested on the front steps before looping back to N. Charles Street to proceed to Penn Station, then City Hall. They joined students from Goucher College, Towson University and other local schools to protest downtown. Despite initial concerns over the protesters’

Freddie Gray’s death has been ruled a homicide, and six officers have been charged in the case, Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced Friday. Three of the Baltimore Police Department officers are charged with involuntary manslaughter, and one is charged with second-degree murder. All have charges of assault and misconduct in office, and warrants were issued for their arrests. Officer Caesar Goodson, Jr., the driver of the van, has been charged with second degree depraved-heart murder, involuntary manslaughter, second degree negligent assault, manslaughter by vehicle by means of gross negligence, manslaughter by vehicle by means of criminal negligence and misconduct in office for failure to secure prison and failure to recognize render aid. Lieutenant Brian Rice has been charged with involuntary manslaughter, assault in the second degree, misconduct in office and false imprisonment.

All charges against the remaining three Baltimore Police Department (BPD) officers implicated in the death of Freddie Gray were dropped yesterday morning. The decision by the office of Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby came after unsuccessful prosecutions of four of the officers between December 2015 and July 2016. The decision to drop charges against Officer Garrett Miller, Officer William Porter and Sergeant Alicia White was announced by Chief Deputy State’s Attorney Michael Schatzow during Miller’s pre-trial hearing on Wednesday. Gray, a 25 year old black man, was transported from the scene of his arrest in Sandtown-Winchester on April 12, 2015 to the Western District police station in a BPD van without being properly restrained. According to the state medical examiner’s office, Gray sustained a fatal spinal cord injury during the “rough ride.” Gray’s death one week after his arrest sparked both peaceful and violent protests, garnering national attention.

By THE EDITORIAL BOARD                                                     | April 30, 2020
Five years ago, Baltimore residents took to the streets to protest the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man from Sandtown-Winchester. Gray died on April 19 from a severe spinal cord injury sustained while in police custody, yet no officer was convicted. Some call the protests “riots.” We call them the Baltimore Uprising. Despite moments of violence that drew disproportionate amounts of national attention during those weeks, the protests were largely peaceful. Gray’s death was one of many instances of police brutality against black residents in Baltimore, catapulting thousands of people — including Hopkins students — into a fight against the systemic inequalities of our city. The Uprising was a turning point for activism on campus. On April 29, 2015, the Black Student Union (BSU) joined demonstrators downtown to protest racial profiling and unjust treatment of black Baltimoreans. Under the leadership of groups like BSU, students pressured the University

As Hopkins transitioned into remote learning in mid-March, so did its student organizations. Community-service based groups in particular have found creative ways to stay active even though many of their members are no longer living in the Baltimore communities which the groups serve. Sophomore Alanna Horowitz is a student volunteer for Thread, an organization which connects student volunteers and community-based volunteers with high-school students in Baltimore. Typically, volunteers support their student both academically, via tutoring, and emotionally, by engaging in their life and checking in on their well-being. In an interview with The News-Letter, Horowitz likened the current situation to times when she has gone home on break. She is one of many volunteers assigned to a pair of twins, others of whom reside full-time in Baltimore. She noted that the distance makes it hard for her to support both students in the ways she can while living on campus.

It wasn’t until 1966 that co-editors Caleb Deschanel and Jim Freedman, both members of the Class of ’66, moved it to the Gatehouse — which was brilliant. I don’t know how they managed it, but the Gatehouse was — and still is — the perfect headquarters for the paper. My main contribution to The News-Letter — and probably to Hopkins — was the creation of the cartoon Blue

Caleb Deschanel was a Managing Editor from 1964-65 and an Editor-in-Chief 1965-66. He is a cinematographer and film director who has been nominated for six Academy Awards. Jim Freedman was a Features Editor 1964-65 and an Editor-in-Chief 1965-66. He is a professor, author and founder of an international consulting firm. The News-Letter: What was your experience of working in journalism in Baltimore? Jim Freedman: Remember that journalism was a bit of a different thing in those days. I mean, it was more noble, in the sense that we were the gutsy soul of the society. It was kind of a bizarre, interesting thing to do. But we were anathema to the administration. Caleb Deschanel: We got called on the carpet weekly. By [University President Milton S.] Eisenhower’s henchmen. JF: We were real bad.

And mounted over the door, a plaque which reads “News Letter Office.” It’s an interesting little structure, says Jim Stimpert, senior reference archivist for the University Archives. “I’ve wondered how many people going up Charles Street, sitting at the red light on Art Museum Drive, have looked over and said, ‘What the heck is that little thing doing over there?’” he said. The structure in question? The Gatehouse. It is either unknown to students or recognized as The News-Letter’s home. But as for why it’s there, on the southern corner of campus and mostly unacknowledged, well, that answer has changed over the 145 years since its construction. It is unknown where The News-Letter staff operated in its earliest days. At a point in the 1900s, the

Hopkins is known as a breeding ground for successful professionals. Whether these professionals are doctors, academics, researchers, engineers or lacrosse players, Hopkins has gained a reputation for placing highly skilled people into high-ranking workforce positions. But is Hopkins also a breeding ground for legendary basketball coaches? Initial research breeds one positive result. Can you guess who it is? I'll give you three clues. He coached his team to an upset victory in the 1983 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game. At the 1993 ESPY Awards he gave one of the most noteworthy and memorable speeches by any sports figure. He has a cancer research foundation established in his memory, which to date has raised over $70 million. The man is James "Jim" Valvano - affectionately referred to by sports junkies as Jimmy V.

Over the past 100 years, Johns Hopkins has had a voluminous history. Replete with breakthroughs and advancements in science, engineering, academia, and education, Hopkins has become one of the world's most elite universities. So what are some of the constants during this century of illustriousness? Hard work? Dedication? Inspiring cafeteria food? How about a staple of the Homewood campus since 1907, the aptly named, Homewood Field. According to "A History of the University" by John French, before the Homewood campus was home to Johns Hopkins, it was fairly difficult to make provisions for sports. The original campus was in downtown Baltimore City, and in order to provide athletics for both undergraduate and graduate students, the school laid out fields for baseball, lacrosse, and football at Clifton Park. But in 1895, Clifton became a public park and reservoir, which meant that Hopkins could not use it for recreation. Players made use

Sixteen individuals, including four undergraduates, one graduate student and one professor from Hopkins, were taken into custody early Wednesday morning after Baltimore City Police intervened to break up a peaceful 500-person celebration of the election results at 33rd and St. Paul Streets. According to witnesses at the scene, Jeffrey Levine, a Hopkins sophomore, was walking home from an election party at around 1 a.m. when he was pushed by police into the lobby of the Bradford apartments, and after confronting the police, he was Tasered. "I definitely saw him being Tasered or shocked or whatever they did to him. At that point he kind of fell backwards and the police grabbed him away into the paddy wagon," said Galen Druke, a Hopkins freshman who witnessed blue sparks from the stun device.

The Hopkins Department of Athletics and Recreation has announced that both men's and women's varsity crew teams will be discontinued, effective at the end of the spring 2009 season. The decision, made last Thursday, was financially motivated. "It is perhaps the most difficult thing I've done in my 20 years here," Director of Athletics Tom Calder said, referring to the decision to disband the crew teams. Calder has spent the last 13 years at Hopkins as athletic director. "The fact that today's poor economic condition is forcing all colleges and universities to begin cutting back in many areas, including student services, only pushed this growing fiscal problem to the surface and made it an immediate budgetary decision," Calder said. The combined crew budgets are currently the most expensive budgets, after the men's and women's lacrosse NCAA Division I budgets, and the costs have continued to increase. As a sport, the

Hopkins undergraduate John Pontolillo, used a samurai sword to kill an intruder in his off-campus residence at the 300 block of E. University Parkway early Tuesday morning. Police detective Donny Moses of the Baltimore Northern Police District reported that the intruder bled out on the scene. According to University spokesman Dennis O'Shea, Hopkins is finding alternate housing for all residents of the house in question. They would also be offered any assistance from Hopkins, including counseling, should it be required. "There may be other things they ask of us, but only time will tell," O'Shea said. The News-Letter confirmed that Pontolillo was the student in question through a number of anonymous sources. The senior from Wall, N.J., has not yet been charged with any crime, although investigations remain ongoing, according to Moses.

Though his controversial blog of sexploits is banned by JHGuestnet, Hopkins paid for students to get the full Tucker Max "experience" in person from his speech on Wednesday. While Max spoke to a crowded Shriver Hall, around 170 people went to a dinner and discussion at One World Cafe to protest his presence on campus. Max opened his speech by saying, "There's enough nerds in here for a Star Trek convention." Max quickly identified the absence of any protesters. "They'd be f--king pissed off if they knew how much I was getting paid for this story. I'd like to buy a new f--king car with what they're paying me. It's kind of embarrassing," Max said.

Fencer Max Wieder knew exactly what was on the line this past weekend at the NCAA Regionals; the senior only needed to win seven more bouts to break the school record for most career wins in Sabre. “I knew coming into Regionals that I was only a few wins away, and while a trip to the NCAA championships was also on the line, it was really important to me to get that record,” Wieder said. In this spirit, Wieder secured his seventh victory of the day against UNC, and tacked on one additional win, to solidify his place in Hopkins fencing history.

President-elect Donald J. Trump’s unlikely victory early Wednesday morning stunned people across the nation and around the world. The results shocked Hopkins students, many of whom expressed frustration and fear. In response, students spray painted the mural boards outside of Brody Learning Commons with phrases including ‘Grab them by the p*ssy’; ‘Do I deserve rights?’; ‘Mourn 4 the USA’; ‘Racism Wins’; and ‘Never Trump.’ Outside the Fresh Food Cafe (FFC), the Blue Jay statue was painted with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign logo and the words ‘F**k Trump’ superimposed. Other students sported Trump apparel on campus. The Republican Party kept control of Congress, winning a majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives.

On the day following President Donald Trump’s inauguration, millions of Americans took to the streets for the largest single-day demonstration in U.S. history. At the Women’s March on Washington, which took place on Jan. 21, protesters demonstrated for women’s and worker’s rights, immigration reform, and LGBT+ and racial equality. Sister marches around the world took place simultaneously in solidarity. In Baltimore, a gathering on 33rd and Charles Street drew several thousand people. There were 673 marches worldwide, on all seven continents. Over 500,000 people marched in Washington D.C., with over 4.9 million participants worldwide. The march was organized online following Trump’s election. Hopkins students who participated in the Women’s March sat down with The News-Letter to share their experiences at the historic event.

You went to a cut-throat high school where success was defined by the number of Advanced Placement courses and Executive Board titles you racked up. You

When I first heard this statistic, I was rather shocked. Throughout my life, my family has ingrained in me the importance of education. I asked myself, “Why do others fail to share these values?” Like many other Hopkins students, my parents are immigrants who traveled to the U.S. for a chance at a more equitable life. As a Public Health graduate, I now understand that despite one’s motivations and desire for mobility, there are still complex socioeconomic factors that keep everyday people from achieving higher education. For that, I am blessed and I

From the friendships formed in the traditional dorm halls of the AMRs or the long nights spent alone in a study room closed off to the world, Hopkins has given me some great times. It does feel a little strange that I’m graduating because I don’t feel any different as an unemployed adult versus as a full-time student.

Sapere aude!” Immanuel Kant screams at me from his essay on enlightenment. “Have the courage to think for yourself.” I look up from my desk on D-Level and feel the bones in my neck crack. It’s been a while since I’ve seen the sun, so I’m pretty sure you can use the fluorescent lights to see through my skin and into my vital organs. Think for yourself. That sounds like pretty good advice, but who has the time? I’m a workaholic. I’ve spent many a weekend, late night and early morning in the dark recesses of the library. I’ve fallen asleep while reading in bed and woken up with highlighter all over my face. I’ve cried in Gilman because I couldn’t make my rhyming couplets work before a deadline, and it is more than fair to say that, at times, I’ve bitten off more than I could chew. At Hopkins,

My friends and I have talked about the exact moment when we found out we got into Hopkins. Everyone remembers their own story in almost perfect detail. I was sitting in my German class on Dec. 14 watching Elf, more nervous than I had ever been, waiting until the clock hit 2:00 p.m. CST. When it hit, I waited three more minutes because I was too terrified to open the admissions website and find out. After the suspense became too much, I opened the early decision portal and logged in. I saw the words “You’ve Been Admitted” and I started crying. My teacher let me go to the hallway and call my parents. The smile on my face didn’t leave for the rest of the day. A lot of our stories went the same way, ending in the jubilation that only a college acceptance can provoke. One of my friends

In March of 2018, The News-Letter reported that Residential Advisors (RA) on financial aid were paying the same out-of-pocket costs — which include tuition and room and board — as they would have been without their position. RAs revealed that they were given room and board via a grant, which was partially or totally subtracted from their Hopkins financial aid packages. This meant that RAs who were receiving financial aid greater than the cost of room and board were essentially working without pay. Several months later, The Office of Residential Life announced that it had revised its RA contract for the 2019-20 academic year, which included an annual stipend of $5,100 to be paid in semi-monthly installments. However, the RA manual now states that RAs are unable to speak directly to media outlets without permission from their supervisors. This year, seven RAs broke this rule to inform The News-Letter of

Students who apply to become Residential Advisors (RAs) assume that one of the benefits of the position will be that their overall costs for the year will decrease. However, RAs who receive financial aid have raised concerns that their out-of-pocket (OOP) costs, which include tuition and room and board, have not decreased significantly since accepting the position. On the other hand, RAs who do not receive financial aid see a dramatic decrease in their overall OOP costs. This academic year, the University provided RAs with free room and board in the form of a $16,858 grant. Students on financial aid typically receive a JHU Grant, which is awarded based on an individual student’s need. According to RAs who receive financial aid, the RA Grant is partially or totally subtracted from their JHU Grant. As a result, their OOP costs remains about the same.

“I started thinking about the jobs I had on campus and how I was going to support myself in terms of rent. How would I pay? Do I go home?” That is how senior Sean Stielow, a First-Generation Limited-Income (FLI) student, recalled his reaction to the announcement on March 10 that in-person classes would be canceled through at least April 12. Eight days later, online classes were extended through the end of the semester. The ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and its effects are exposing and deepening inequality across the country. The University has extended over $5 million to students and their families in the form of emergency grants; however, the pandemic and transition to remote learning still pose unique challenges for students from low-income families and students who are the first in their family to attend college.

Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Sunil Kumar announced in an email to the student body that the Krieger School of Arts & Sciences (KSAS) and Whiting School of Engineering (WSE) will adopt a universal satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) grading system this semester. The email, which was sent on March 27, states that the administration acknowledges that the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak — which prompted all University courses to proceed online — pose a variety of challenges that not all students would share. An additional email sent by KSAS and WSE clarified that all undergraduate grades will be limited to S or U grades with no impact on a student’s overall GPA. Additionally, all courses necessary for degree requirements can be fulfilled by a satisfactory grade.

Following the University’s announcement that students would not be allowed to remain in on-campus housing past March 15 amid the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, The News-Letter interviewed residential students about their transition to off-campus housing. Many of the students were frustrated by having to negotiate new housing arrangements on short notice and felt that the University did not give them sufficient information throughout the process. Charles Commons resident Yoko Yamashita, an international student from Japan, stated that the University made moving off campus extremely difficult. “My experience has been full of confusion, anxiety and frustration,” she said. “The whole process could not have been any harder... They kind of just left us to do everything by ourselves.” McCoy Hall resident Brian Li echoed Yamashita’s sentiments. “It’s just been frankly a blur.

The Student Government Association (SGA) endorsed a letter calling on University President Ronald J. Daniels and Board of Trustees Chair Louis J. Forster to remit 25 percent of students’ spring 2020 tuition at their weekly meeting on March 31. SGA also discussed how it will continue operating in the wake of the cancellation of in-person classes and heard a presentation from a group of graduate students on issues with the Student Conduct Code violation adjudication process. Senior Class President Pavan Patel, who prepared the letter, argued that this would be an appropriate way to compensate students for the loss of half-of-a-semester’s worth of in-person instruction and campus access while not hampering the University’s ability to meet its payroll obligations. Asking students to pay regular tuition during an irregular situation, Patel said, is not right. “We understand the situation and fully appreciate the work that’s being done. But at the end

Johns Hopkins Medicine will open the Center for Transgender Health by early spring of next year. The Center aims to provide transgender people with a lifelong healthcare program. The News-Letter sat down with Paula Neira, the new director of the center and a former officer in the U.S. Navy. Neira left the military to transition from male to female, and now works as a nurse educator at Hopkins. Healthcare services provided by the Center will include gender affirmation surgeries and other services for transgender people to receive proper medical treatment. After the new year, the Center will begin working with adult patients who have already contacted the hospital for gender affirmation surgery. Neira spoke about the ongoing discrimination faced by the trans community in healthcare. “The transgender population faces lots of health disparities,” she said. “One of the initiatives at Johns Hopkins Medicine is to look at health disparities and

For months, activists have criticized the University for failing to condemn a paper published by two Hopkins affiliates in The New Atlantis last August. The paper suggests that biology does not play a role in determining sexuality and gender identity and argues that children who identify as a different gender will likely grow out of it. In response to the report’s publication, this March the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) deducted 25 points from Johns Hopkins Hospital’s Healthcare Equality Index (HEI). The HEI evaluates healthcare facilities’ practices related to their treatment of LGBT+ communities. The report was co-authored by Lawrence Mayer, a scholar in residence at the School of Medicine, and Paul McHugh, a professor of psychiatry there. While the University has not released an official statement, Hopkins faculty and community members have opposed the paper. Over 600 people signed a petition demanding that the University publicly disavow the report. Last

This semester, the University hired Fenimore Fisher, its first vice provost for diversity and inclusion and chief diversity officer. He joined the Hopkins community on Oct. 23. Fisher has spent over 20 years working on diversity and inclusion initiatives. He previously worked as chief diversity officer for New York City. He was also vice president of diversity initiatives and analysis for Walmart and began his diversity career in the nonprofit sector.

Starting this semester, Blackboard and the Student Information System (SIS) will pull preferred name information directly from myJH. The initiative builds on updates made this past spring, which allowed Hopkins students, staff and faculty to designate a preferred name on myJH profiles. This is one of the changes that a special committee implemented to improve the University’s online systems. The committee had support from IT@JHU, the Office of Institutional Equity, Human Resources and LGBTQ Life. To promote a more inclusive and safe environment, the people who spearheaded this change recognized the insufficiency of the “nickname” option that was previously offered and added the “preferred name” option as part of the myProfile section in the myJHU portal. Junior James Dweck, who is transgender, described his excitement upon logging into Blackboard and discovering that his name was appropriately reflected. “I went through a legal name change last October, so almost a year

Thank you from The News-Letter Back to The News-Letter 2021 Commencement Magazine To all graduating students: Well, that was certainly unexpected.Starting off 2020, you probably weren’t ready for so many curveballs. Most obviously, a global pandemic turned all our in-person lectures into Zoom calls, moving our desks from our classrooms to our bedrooms. Some of you graduates pulled all-nighters every night to take classes from the other side of the world, while others here in Baltimore were made to spit into little plastic vials three times a week to be allowed on campus. And while all this was happening, you witnessed (and often participated in) a presidential election, protests and political unrest during one of the most hectic and inconsistent years in the Univeristy’s history.But even before your senior year,

Fully vaccinated and hoping to feel something, I went to Power Plant Live! last Thursday for the first time since the pandemic started. As I squeezed past peers I hadn’t been indoors with in eons, I was reminded of the Brood X cicadas that have descended upon the nation. With life seemingly returning to “normal” in the United States, we are emerging en masse like those horny, red-eyed banshees. We’ve spent what feels like 17 years underground, and we are loud, emotionally starved and half-dead shells of who we used to be. In the past two weeks, I, with the energy of a cicada, have tried to do as many things and see as many people as possible. While I didn’t ride the bull at Power Plant last week, I am trying to live my life to the fullest before I graduate. It’s similar to what the cicadas are doing

Located in Towson among many other shops and restaurants is a small, Chinese all-you-can-eat hot pot place called New Generation. It is a familiar location to many Hopkins students, but for me, it’s something even more special. Hot pot, the literal translation of which from Chinese is “fire pot” (火锅), is a traditional cuisine originating from the Sichuan province. With a history of over 2000 years, it has spread across the entire nation and now even the whole world, gaining popularity and love. However, I never liked hot pot when I was growing up. It was always too loud and warm; the taste became monotonous after everything was dipped in the same sauce and there always was an aftertaste from the soup full of additives that just made me scream “WATER.” Shortly after coming to Hopkins, one of my Chinese friends suggested going to New Generation in Towson.

After rounds of delays due to the pandemic, the grand release of the live-action movie Mulan had gained a lot of hype and excitement. However, this only made it extra disappointing when I finally watched it. After its release in Chinese cinema on Sept. 11, the rating dropped sharply to 4.9/10 on Douban within two days. So, without a doubt, I am able to say: I did not enjoy the movie at all nor the cinematic imperialism it represents. The story follows the journey of Mulan, who has been scolded by her mother from a young age to be less plucky. “A daughter brings honor through marriage,” her mother tells her. But when Mulan’s father, a wounded warrior, must join the army to maintain familial honor, Mulan grabs his sword and rides off into the night and sacrifices herself to protect him.

Two types of vaccines show promise. The mRNA vaccines are less likely to provoke adverse reactions, but they may be hard to deliver to tropical regions due to the requirement of storage at incredibly low temperatures. The other type of vaccine consists of the inactivated virus, like Russia’s Sputnik V, China’s Sinovac and China National Biotec Group vaccines.

It’s been almost two months since Taylor Swift dropped evermore, her second album of 2020, when the world was devoid of severity, compassion and inspiration. It was a nice surprise to her fan base — myself included — after the initial release of evermore’s sister album in July of 2020, folklore. Among songs of distinct themes and genres, I notice a common thread that strings together the two albums: escapism. Without a doubt, folklore and evermore are the culmination of Swift’s imagination and hard work amid a pandemic that shook the world, but they are also media Swift uses to distract herself from the woes, anger and tragedies of an unprecedentedly chaotic year. On August 21, Swift explained that she has her own way of looking at the songs on folklore: To her, they fit together thematically in different groups and “chapters.” The first one she shared is “folklore: the

The 10th anniversary of the Fukushima Daiichi accident, when an unexpected earthquake generated a tsunami that destroyed the nuclear power plant’s backup generators, fell on March 11. The loss of power and consequent failure of the cooling system resulted in the elevation of residual heat. In an attempt to cool things down, seawater was continuously pumped to the reactor, but ultimately the core still partially melted down. Since then, the disposal of this radioactive seawater has presented a challenge. On April 13, Japan announced its decision to release the Daiichi wastewater into the Pacific Ocean. The biggest driver for this decision was that the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company, would run out of storage by fall of 2022. According to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, release into the sea was unavoidable in order to achieve Fukushima’s recovery.

If you never hear the phrases “during these unprecedented times” and “twice-weekly testing” again, it will be too soon.Despite it all, your resilience and determination are evident in how you’ve made the best of your time here at Hopkins. You’ve filled out the Marriage Pact then promptly ghosted your match, made it to the reopening of the Ralph S. O’Connor Center for Recreation and Well-Being, swanned the ice rink and navigated constantly changing testing policies (too many links

The Ralph S. O’Connor Recreation Center, which underwent a large-scale renovation process over the course of the pandemic, was unveiled yesterday. The University originally announced that the project would be finished before students returned to campus for the fall, but unforeseen issues delayed the construction process. In an interview with The News-Letter, Director of Recreation and Facilities Bill Harrington explained why construction took longer than expected. “While we had hoped to open sooner, anticipated dates are subject to many variables,” he said. “In recent months, we have experienced some material and labor shortages like the rest of the world.” Despite its opening, there will be ongoing construction to complete before the facility is fully operational, Harrington noted. Students have voiced frustrations about the delays in construction. Sophomore Jayden Chiu explained that his alternative to the Rec Center has been inconvenient in several ways. “It’s been kind of annoying because I

The Ralph O’Connor Center for Recreation and Well-Being is scheduled for completion by Oct. 4 and will open at full capacity by mid-October. The University announced plans to expand the Recreation (Rec) Center in 2020. The Rec Center is currently open at limited capacity, with less than usual cardio and strength equipment, basketball courts, the bouldering cave, the climbing wall and group fitness classes available to Hopkins affiliates. No prior registration is required, nor are there density limits. Bill Harrington, senior associate athletic director and director of recreation and facilities, explained that one of the goals of construction is to rebrand the center to include the Center for Health Education and Well-Being in an interview with The News-Letter. “Instead of being just the Ralph S. O’Connor Recreation Center, it’s the Ralph S. O’Connor Center for Recreation and Well-Being,” he said. “It’s transformational both in design and in sincere interest in

A matchmaking service recently launched on campus to mixed reviews. The Hopkins Marriage Pact claims to promote new connections between students, primarily platonic. However, students are still seeking clarity after promotional materials and the survey itself seem to emphasize sexual relationships. In fall 2017, Stanford University students Liam McGregor and Sophia Sterling-Angus created the Marriage Pact as a project for an economics class. They designed a 50-question survey meant to find the most compatible matches on campus. During its first week at Stanford, over half of the campus participated. The nonprofit took off during the pandemic and is now active at 55 schools. The service operates on the basis that college is the largest pool of similarly aged people that most will ever be in, and that many people marry their college classmates. According to the Hopkins Marriage Pact, the service has since shifted to emphasize more casual matches. Freshman

The Student Government Association (SGA) held its weekly general board meeting on Tuesday, Sept. 7 to revisit an email written by Junior Class Senator Peter Huang concerning the requirement for international students’ to receive COVID-19 vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration despite having already received vaccines approved by the World Health Organization. Huang explained that the central message of the letter is for international students to receive assurance and support from the University should things go wrong. He outlined his process for writing the letter, written with the sole intention of reflecting the voices of international students. “Most of the stuff that I wrote on this email was from two weeks ago, and they were directly coming out of the mouths from international students that have messaged me who were concerned about the new vaccination policy,” he said. “This is not scientifically cited, but it is cited from

The Hopkins Student Organization for Programming (HOP), a student-run social programming group that contributed to Spring Fair planning this year, released an online matchmaking survey on Monday, April 19 via an Instagram post. The survey was originally going to be part of the hybrid in-person Spring Fair that started on Friday, April 23. According to HOP Executive Chair Amal Hayat, the University paid $75 to Fortress Software Inc. to facilitate the survey. One question asked students to indicate their gender identity based on their “anatomical parts” and whether they preferred to be matched with someone with the same or opposite anatomical parts. Sophomore Tomisin Longe, one of the first students to directly contact the HOP about the survey, noted the harm of such questions. “An obvious issue is the fact that it’s very reductive to reduce people to their ‘anatomical parts,’” they said. “It’s also a very intrusive question to

The newly elected Student Government Association (SGA) held its first in-person meeting of the year on Tuesday, August 31 to discuss past projects and prepare for the upcoming semester. Junior Senator Chinat Yu highlighted the recent difficulties faced by international students due to school vaccination mandates requiring the taking of a vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), even if they had taken one cleared by the World Health Organization (WHO). “Our big concern is that there is no scientific proof about what happens if you have two mixed vaccine shots within a short period of time,” Yu said. Junior Senator Peter Huang had been working on an email to be sent to school officials, hoping the University would assume some responsibilities for the mixed vaccine registration if it negatively impacts students’ health. “A lot of international students come without their families. All we have is the support

The senior class council held the senior Met Gala on April 2 in commemoration of their upcoming graduation. Seniors were able to choose between two types of tickets, photo and general admission, and could purchase one ticket for their attendance. In an email to The News-Letter, Senior Class President Nathan Mudrak explained that there were 300 confirmed registrations with 25 guaranteed walk-ins. There were 26 people on the waitlist, and all walk-ins were admitted. He shared that 251 guests were checked in through Hopkins Groups, but he estimated attendance was around 275 since some guests did not check in. Mudrak was impressed by the number of seniors who registered for the event. Because of the number of students interested in attending, the council decided to negotiate its initial contract with the venue. “This allowed us to both allow all seniors who registered within the first hour to have a confirmed

The University reinstated several COVID-19 safety protocols in an email sent to undergraduate students on May 6, including updated masking and testing guidance. Undergraduate students will be required to test twice a week and masking will now be required in libraries and study areas, including Brody Learning Commons, given its increased use during finals week. Guests helping students move out of residence halls will also be required to wear masks. The email noted the uptick in cases came in the wake of student events, including the Meek Mill concert on April 30. On May 10, the campus dashboard reported that 531 students had tested positive for COVID-19 in the last seven days. Vice President for Communications Andrew Green discussed the University’s decision to expand COVID-19 protocols in an email to The News-Letter. “Given the changed circumstances, we have since reinstated required masking at large (greater than 50 people) indoor events,
