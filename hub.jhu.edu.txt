Their creations range from a small hovering aircraft that can land in a tree branch as effortlessly as a bird to a hand-held device that enables breast cancer treatment in rural clinics. "If we haven't been here quite 24 hours a day, it sometimes feels like it," says David Levi, a senior mechanical engineering major, looking around the department's cluttered senior design space in the basement of the Wyman Park building, where he and teammates are refining their prototype.

Johns Hopkins responds to Ebola                 | Hub

Johns Hopkins responds to Ebola As of April 8, 2015, the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus has claimed more than 10,000 lives, primarily in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. There have been nearly 23,000 reported or suspected cases of the disease. In response to this rapidly evolving public health crisis, Johns Hopkins experts convened in early October to discuss experimental medical countermeasures, recommendations to prevent the spread of the disease, and the complex ethical decisions that need to be made in real-time. Since then, Johns Hopkins experts have worked together to design a prototype protective suit for health workers who treat Ebola patients, and our faculty members have actively worked with the media to share their knowledge about the spread and treatment of the virus. As members of the Johns Hopkins community respond to the outbreak, this page will be updated with relevant information

Faculty members from the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics recently shared their thoughts on some of these difficult questions. Should there be a travel ban from Ebola-infected countries? Holly Taylor, Berman Institute core faculty: No. There is no evidence that travel bans have been effective in limiting the spread of infectious disease in any previous infectious disease outbreak and it is unlikely that any such ban on Ebola-infected countries will limit the spread of Ebola. Indeed our attention should be on how best to help Ebola-infected countries where the outbreak is raging rather than spending any human

And limited robotic automation is already used in surgeries involving rigid structures such as bones. But can a robot handle the slips and squirms of soft tissues during a surgery? Simon Leonard, a Johns Hopkins University computer scientist, is part of a team that has published research showing that a robot surgeon can indeed adjust to the subtle movement and deformation of soft tissue to execute precise and consistent suturing.

How Johns Hopkins doctors helped bring CPR to the mainstream By Hub staff report / Published Nov 8, 2013 Until 1960, the only way to treat cardiac arrest was for the surgeon to open a patient's chest and, holding the heart in his or her hands, squeeze blood to vital organs. Then, a group of surgeons at Johns Hopkins forever changed the standard emergency room routine. The surgeons, who had also developed the external cardiac defibrillator, tried a new CPR technique called closed-chest cardiac massage‚Äîpumping the arrested heart without surgically opening the chest. They reported that they were able to successfully resuscitate every one of the first 20 patients they treated; 14 of those patients survived without brain damage. Soon after the Johns Hopkins doctors reported their success, closed-chest cardiac massage crept into the mainstream, becoming the go-to procedure for all cardiac arrests in U.S. hospitals.

It's the first installment in an occasional Johns Hopkins Medicine video series called "Science: Out of the Box," in which complex science is explained in simple, easy-to-understand terms. With children's modeling clay, apparently. Ewald and his team at the Center for Cell Dynamics have recently pinpointed a specific cell type that helps different breast tumors metastatize. This is a big deal, Ewald explains, because if scientists can turn off the gene linked to that cell type‚Äîcalled leader cells‚Äîthen they can stop the cancer from spreading.

Johns Hopkins offers new major in medicine, science, humanities By Kate Pipkin / Published March-April 2015 The Krieger School of Arts and Sciences has launched the medicine, science, and humanities major for students who want to examine medical and scientific issues through the lens of humanities studies. The new interdisciplinary major gives Johns Hopkins undergraduates the chance to pursue the natural sciences and the humanities, rather than having to choose one or the other. Beverly Wendland, interim dean of the Krieger School, says the major was created in part to help close the polarizing gap between the sciences and the humanities. "Given our academic strengths, Johns Hopkins is ideally suited to create a course of undergraduate concentration that focuses on the intersection of medicine, science, and the humanities," Wendland says.

Researchers begin to unravel complex medical mysteries using digital tools Computational medicine enhances the way doctors detect, treat disease By Phil Sneiderman / Published Nov 5, 2012 Computational medicine, a fast-growing method of using computer models and sophisticated software to figure out how disease develops‚Äîand how to thwart it‚Äîhas begun to leap off the drawing board and land in the hands of doctors who treat patients for heart ailments, cancer, and other illnesses. Using digital tools, researchers have begun to use experimental and clinical data to build models that can unravel complex medical mysteries. These are some of the conclusions of a new review of the field published in the Oct. 31 issue of the journal Science Translational Medicine. The article, "Computational Medicine: Translating Models to Clinical Care," was written by four Johns Hopkins professors affiliated with the university's Institute for Computational Medicine.

Under the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman, Windsor was not entitled to the federal estate tax exemption for surviving spouses. When the Supreme Court decided 5-4 in Windsor's favor last June, it declared that DOMA violated the U.S. Constitution by barring legally married, same-sex couples from enjoying the benefits of marriage conferred under federal law.

Three months later, in a 5-4 decision, the justices agreed. The court's ruling in United States vs. Windsor overturned section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, which had excluded gay couples from more than 1,100 federal provisions, such as filing taxes jointly, claiming Social Security survivor benefits, and‚Äîin the case of Kaplan's client, Edith Windsor‚Äîclaiming the federal estate tax exemption for surviving spouses.

Daniels for "pioneering a strongly collaborative approach with the communities around Homewood and to the south." The model of city institutions and communities working together towards shared goals is one that Daniels has experience with from his days at the University of Pennsylvania, The Sun notes, and one that can and should be emulated in Baltimore. The $10 million is certainly significant, but of more lasting‚Äîand replicable‚Äîimportance is the structure for collaboration that preceded it. As important as Hopkins has been to the city, it has not always been trusted. The process by which the Homewood Community Partners Initiative was developed‚Äîhundreds of

Commentary: Blame biased policies and politics, not black culture By Hub staff report / Published May 1, 2015 Nathan Connolly, an assistant professor of history at Johns Hopkins University, writes about the economics behind the recent unrest in Baltimore in today's issue of The New York Times. In "Black Culture Is Not the Problem," Connolly asserts that "policy and politics" played a larger role in the events that unfolded earlier this week in Baltimore than did some shortcoming of black culture. From The Times: Specifically, the problem rests on the continued profitability of racism. Freddie Gray's exposure to lead paint as a child, his suspected participation in the drug trade, and the relative confinement of black unrest to black communities during this week's riot are all features of a city and a country that still segregate people along racial lines, to the financial enrichment of landlords, corner store merchants and

In the first examination of the magnitude of in-kind child support, published this month in the Journal of Marriage and Family, the team found many disadvantaged noncustodial fathers spend an average of $60 a month on in-kind provisions, while dads paying formal child support spend about $38 a month. Men who were the most disadvantaged tended to give a higher proportion of their support in gifts, the study found.

Johns Hopkins 11th in first 'U.S. News' Best Global University rankings Rankings based on academic research performance, global reputation By Hub staff report / Published Oct 29, 2014 Johns Hopkins University is the 11th best university in the world, according to the first ever Best Global University rankings published by U.S. News & World Report on Tuesday. The rankings use different criteria than those used for the annual "best colleges" list, on which Johns Hopkins ranked 12th last month. The new rankings include 500 universities in 49 countries. Sixteen of the top 20 universities are in the U.S., including Harvard, which tops the rankings. Institutions are ranked based on their academic research performance and their global and regional reputations. By contrast, the U.S. News "best colleges" list released in September puts more emphasis on undergraduate academic reputation, retention of students, and how selective a university is.

The research provides crucial new evidence that it is these jets of "radio-frequency feedback" streaming from mature galaxies' central black holes that prevent hot free gas from cooling and collapsing into baby stars. "When you look into the past history of the universe, you see these galaxies building stars," said Tobias Marriage, assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins and co-lead author of the study.

Johns Hopkins engineers created a computer model to predict the increasing vulnerability of power grids in major coastal cities during hurricanes. By factoring historic hurricane information with plausible scenarios for future storm behavior, the team determined which of 27 cities, from Texas to Maine, will become more susceptible to blackouts from future hurricanes. The list of cities most likely to see big increases in power outage risk is topped by New York City; Philadelphia; Jacksonville, Florida; Virginia Beach, Virginia; and Hartford, Connecticut.

Dolphin study could yield insight into how mercury influences health Johns Hopkins researchers partner with Singapore's Resorts World Sentosa to study Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins with controlled diets Credit: Resorts World Sentosa By Phil Sneiderman / Published April 1, 2015 Johns Hopkins environmental scientists are collaborating with researchers from Dolphin Island at Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore to learn more about how and where mercury accumulates in the bodies of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins. The partnership was formed because aquariums and zoological institutions are uniquely qualified to conduct research involving aquatic animals in their care in order to help protect and conserve wild populations of similar animals‚Äîin this case, dolphins. It is very difficult to obtain critical data on populations in nature due to difficulties in gathering details on diet, overall health, and related issues. The researchers are analyzing blood samples and health records from 10 dolphins that have been under the

Element of surprise helps babies learn best, Johns Hopkins researchers say Infants seek out more information about objects that defy expectations Video: Dave Schmelick, Len Turner, Deirdre Hammer By Jill Rosen / Published April 2, 2015 Infants have innate knowledge about the world, and when their expectations are defied, they learn best, researchers at Johns Hopkins University found. In a paper that will be published Friday in the journal Science, cognitive psychologists Aimee E. Stahl and Lisa Feigenson demonstrate for the first time that babies learn new things by leveraging the core information with which they are born. When something surprises a baby, like an object not behaving the way she expects it to, she not only focuses on that object but ultimately learns more about it than from a similar yet predictable object. "For young learners, the world is an incredibly complex place filled with dynamic stimuli. How do

Rapid plankton growth in ocean seen as sign of carbon dioxide loading Johns Hopkins-led study suggests faster ecosystem change than predicted By Arthur Hirsch / Published Nov 26, 2015 A microscopic marine alga is thriving in the North Atlantic to an extent that defies scientific predictions, suggesting swift environmental change as a result of increased carbon dioxide in the ocean, a study led by a Johns Hopkins University scientist has found. What these findings mean remains to be seen, as does whether the rapid growth in the tiny plankton's population is good or bad news for the planet. Published today in the journal Science, the study details a tenfold increase in the abundance of single-cell coccolithophores between 1965 and 2010, and a particularly sharp spike since the late 1990s in the population of these pale-shelled floating phytoplankton.

In late June, a line of severe storms moved across the Upper Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, leaving nearly 4 million power customers without electricity.

What if they knew in advance how many people would lose power, and where? Seth Guikema, a Johns Hopkins School of Engineering researcher who specializes in risk assessment and risk management, wants to give utilities the tools to answer those complex questions.

The study, published in The International Journal of Cancer, presents an interesting contradiction to past research linking prostate cancer with the type of inflammation found with asthma. The new study discovered that males with a history of asthma were 29 percent less likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer that spread or became fatal. Overall, asthmatic men were 36 percent less likely to die of the disease. But it's too early to conclude that asthma may in some way protect men from prostate cancer, cautions Elizabeth A.

Using tests conducted on bees, a team led by Andrew Feinberg, a professor of molecular medicine at Johns Hopkins and director of the Center for Epigenetics at Hopkins' Institute for Basic Biomedical Science, found that marks on DNA were directly related to specific behaviors and that when behaviors changed, so did the DNA marks.

Johns Hopkins increases investment in restructured Baltimore Scholars Program Focus shifts to high-achieving students with significant financial need By Tracey Reeves / Published March 24, 2016 The Johns Hopkins University will restructure its Baltimore Scholars Program to offer greater financial aid and more robust supports to high-achieving Baltimore City Public School graduates with significant financial need. The shift represents a boost in the university's financial investment in the program. Over the last five years, Johns Hopkins has spent $11.6 million on the Baltimore Scholars Program; in the next five, it will spend more than $20 million. Launched in 2004 to provide full-tuition scholarships to any admitted graduates of city public schools, the Baltimore Scholars Program is a reflection of the university's long-standing investment in Baltimore's students and schools. The program recognizes high-potential students from the communities around Johns Hopkins campuses and has attracted more than 180 of the city's brightest

The name of the series refers to the historical practice of denying services‚Äîhealth care, mortgage loans, even access to supermarkets‚Äîto residents in certain areas based on the racial or ethnic makeup of those areas.

The findings, published last month in PLOS Currents Outbreaks, suggest that people's attitudes toward this new mosquito control method may be tied to their concerns about risks of contracting diseases including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika from the insects.

The study does not establish a definitive causal link, experts note, but it does connect Zika virus to cell abnormalities. Though microcephaly can be caused by a number of genetic, viral, and environmental factors, the abnormal cellular behavior seen in the study was produced solely by the Zika virus, researchers say.

Zika virus: Questions remain about transmission, prevention By Hub staff report / Published Feb 25, 2016 Experts gathered last week at a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health symposium to address the Zika virus, explore emerging evidence, and evaluate the public health response. Presenters focused in particular on evidence that Zika virus is linked to birth defects, a connection supported by strong anecdotal evidence. But a number of questions remain about the nature of the virus, how it spreads, and how to quell the current outbreak. Below is a closer look at some of what the experts had to say last week. How fast can we develop an effective vaccine? Steve Whitehead from the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Disease presented the standard pathway for vaccine development, which includes evaluating animal test models, preparing materials, and conducting three phases of human testing

How to protect yourself from Zika virus while traveling to affected areas Video: Hopkins Medicine By Hub staff report / Published Feb 29, 2016 Zika virus has emerged as a major health concern in some parts of the world, particularly in South America and Central America, prompting the World Health Organization to declare a "public health emergency of international concern" earlier this month. So how can people traveling to Zika-affected areas and other warmer climates protect themselves from the mosquito-borne virus? The key, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine expert Crystal Aguh, is to keep the mosquitoes away. Experts recommend: Clothing Wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts Wear clothing treated with permethrin Insect repellant Apply Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved insect repellent to areas of exposed skin. Mosquito repellents containing DEET are considered the most effective. Insect repellents that contain ingredients such as oil of citronella, picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus

Global health Maternal health expert: New study 'incredibly important' to understanding of Zika virus, how it affects infants By Saralyn Lyons / Published March 4, 2016 Researchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and two other schools published a study today that offers compelling evidence of a biological link between Zika virus and microcephaly and could give scientists key insights into how to treat the virus. The study does not establish a definitive causal link, experts note, but it does connect Zika virus to cell abnormalities. Though microcephaly can be caused by a number of genetic, viral, and environmental factors, the abnormal cellular behavior seen in the study was produced solely by the Zika virus, researchers say. "I think the study is going to be incredibly important to the understanding of how microcephaly develops," says Jeanne Sheffield, director of the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at JHU's School of Medicine

Exposure to the virus led to a high percentage of miscarriages and to mouse pups born with thin brain tissue and inflammation in brain cells. By administering Zika virus directly into the reproductive tract of pregnant mice that had intact immune systems, the researchers found that the disorganization in the cells of the placenta could explain how the virus reaches the fetus.

Study sheds light on how cancer stem cells thrive when oxygen is scarce By Hub staff report / Published April 1, 2016 Scientists have known for a while that low oxygen can encourage cancer stem cells to multiply within a tumor. But a research team at Johns Hopkins University recently zeroed in on exactly how that happens. The researchers looked at the similarities between embryonic stem cells and cancer stem cells, ultimately focusing on a specific protein that increases the numbers of cancer stem cells in low-oxygen conditions. The team's findings, published March 21 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could help clear a major roadblock in cancer treatments, given that cancer cells that thrive in low oxygen are particularly likely to metastasize and resist chemotherapy.

Whether it's a sound made by a computer or a production process that relies on digital recording and editing technologies, almost all popular music owes a debt to electronic music, which began its slow climb into the mainstream from the academic research laboratories and avant-garde composer's desks of the 1950s. But that seepage into nearly every facet of music production has also winnowed an understanding of electronic music's wide range of ideas, practitioners, and points of view that have run through the art form since its earliest days.
