Summer Gigs Out of this world: Working on the International Space Station project Hopkins students tell us what they're up to during summer break By Sophia Porter / Published Aug 7, 2017 I stepped into the D.C. Metro station with a handful of people from the International Space Station Conference. Our conversation paused as we approached a mother struggling to balance a two-seat stroller on the escalator, her toddler son trailing behind. A man from my group offered his hand to the toddler and they rode down the escalator together. As I watched the mother ferry her children into the train car, it struck me that the boy would never know he'd been helped down an escalator by a man who had piloted a spacecraft.

Johns Hopkins responds to Ebola As of April 8, 2015, the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus has claimed more than 10,000 lives, primarily in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. There have been nearly 23,000 reported or suspected cases of the disease. In response to this rapidly evolving public health crisis, Johns Hopkins experts convened in early October to discuss experimental medical countermeasures, recommendations to prevent the spread of the disease, and the complex ethical decisions that need to be made in real-time. Since then, Johns Hopkins experts have worked together to design a prototype protective suit for health workers who treat Ebola patients, and our faculty members have actively worked with the media to share their knowledge about the spread and treatment of the virus.

How protective gear is removed poses risk of deadly Ebola exposure Physical and emotional fatigue are factors in 'inadvertent' contamination By Mark Guidera / Published Sept 9, 2014 A team of American infectious disease and critical care experts is alerting colleagues caring for Ebola patients that how they remove their personal protective gear can be just as crucial as wearing it to prevent exposure to the deadly virus. In a commentary published online on Aug. 26 in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the physician-specialists from Johns Hopkins and the University of North Carolina say rigorous steps exist‚Äîand must be taken‚Äîto avoid "inadvertent" contact of frontline caregivers' exposed skin and mucous membranes to infected body fluids.

Five common questions about Ebola Learn the facts about Ebola's symptoms and how it spreads By Hub staff report / Published Oct 17, 2014 The World Health Organization recently reported that there have been nearly 9,000 cases and 5,000 deaths from Ebola virus in seven countries. The outbreak‚Äîcentered in the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea‚Äîhas rapidly become a public health crisis, with the CDC estimating that 1.4 million could become infected in Liberia and Sierra Leone by January. On Oct. 7, the first patient diagnosed with Ebola virus outside of Africa, Thomas Eric Duncan, died at a hospital in Dallas, Texas. Duncan, 42, contracted Ebola in Liberia before traveling to Dallas, where he was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept. 28.

Berman Institute bioethicists answer Ebola-related questions Outbreak of virus in West Africa raises complex ethical challenges By Hub staff report / Published Oct 23, 2014 As the Ebola virus continues to spread across West Africa, complex ethical challenges abound related to the use of untested interventions, quarantines, special care, and other issues. Faculty members from the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics recently shared their thoughts on some of these difficult questions. Should there be a travel ban from Ebola-infected countries? Holly Taylor, Berman Institute core faculty: No. There is no evidence that travel bans have been effective in limiting the spread of infectious disease in any previous infectious disease outbreak and it is unlikely that any such ban on Ebola-infected countries will limit the spread of Ebola. Indeed our attention should be on how best to help Ebola-infected countries where the outbreak is raging rather than spending any human

And limited robotic automation is already used in surgeries involving rigid structures such as bones. But can a robot handle the slips and squirms of soft tissues during a surgery? Simon Leonard, a Johns Hopkins University computer scientist, is part of a team that has published research showing that a robot surgeon can indeed adjust to the subtle movement and deformation of soft tissue to execute precise and consistent suturing. The research, which was published earlier this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine, promises to improve results for patients and make the best surgical techniques more widely available.

How Johns Hopkins doctors helped bring CPR to the mainstream By Hub staff report / Published Nov 8, 2013 Until 1960, the only way to treat cardiac arrest was for the surgeon to open a patient's chest and, holding the heart in his or her hands, squeeze blood to vital organs. Then, a group of surgeons at Johns Hopkins forever changed the standard emergency room routine. The surgeons, who had also developed the external cardiac defibrillator, tried a new CPR technique called closed-chest cardiac massage‚Äîpumping the arrested heart without surgically opening the chest. They reported that they were able to successfully resuscitate every one of the first 20 patients they treated; 14 of those patients survived without brain damage. Soon after the Johns Hopkins doctors reported their success, closed-chest cardiac massage crept into the mainstream, becoming the go-to procedure for all cardiac arrests in U.S. hospitals.

For the study, investigators from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania surveyed and tracked the activities of thousands of first-year residents in 63 internal medicine training programs nationwide. The study‚Äîwhich is part of a five-year effort funded by the National Heart, Lung

"No two people experience pain the same way," she says. "We can give hundreds of people the same stimulus and each person's going to have a different response." Haythornthwaite teaches the Pain Care Medicine course that's required for all first-year Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine students. During four days of instruction, students hear from Johns Hopkins patients, surgeons, pharmacists, physical therapists, and nurses. Haythornthwaite, a psychologist, discusses psychosocial issues such as poor sleep and depression, which can result from pain and also make pain

Often the interventional radiologists who perform these important procedures must try several times in order to successfully stop the bleeding. A team of students from Johns Hopkins University's Department of Materials Science and Engineering has developed a "super gel" that has the potential to eventually make this process easier, less expensive, and more efficient. The gel can pass through a catheter‚Äîthe delivery vehicle of choice‚Äîbut is hyper-absorbent enough to then swell with blood, creating a clot

Researchers report first-ever protein hydrogels made in living cells Artificial formation of these difficult-to-study cell structures could advance the understanding of how they contribute to diseases such as ALS By Shawna Williams / Published Nov 6, 2017 Johns Hopkins cell biologists report what they believe is the first-ever creation of tiny, gelatin-like clumps called hydrogels inside living cells. The ability to create hydrogels on demand, they say, could advance the effort to study elusive cell structures that form in nature under certain conditions‚Äîand to uncover how these structures contribute to human diseases. Too many or too few natural hydrogels could affect a cell's ability to function, and may be linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Lou Gehrig's disease. "The exciting part of this work is not just that we made hydrogels, but that we're now equipped with this powerful technique that lets us ask fundamental and very challenging questions about

Johns Hopkins surgeons perform double arm transplant By Hub staff report / Published Jan 29, 2013 The Washington Post reported on Monday that a team of surgeons from Johns Hopkins Hospital had performed a rare double arm transplant on a former soldier. Brendan Marrocco, 26, lost all four of his limbs in an explosion three years ago, when he was serving in Iraq. Last month, a team of transplant experts, led by W.P. Andrew Lee, professor and chairman of Johns Hopkins' Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, performed the multihour operation. It was only the seventh successful double arm transplant performed in the United States. Lee said results in such cases have been good, although transplanted arms are never going to have 100 percent of the function of the limbs they replace. But he said patients have learned to tie shoes, use chopsticks, and put their hair in ponytails. Read
