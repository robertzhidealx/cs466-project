Summer Gigs Out of this world: Working on the International Space Station project Hopkins students tell us what they're up to during summer break By Sophia Porter / Published Aug 7, 2017 I stepped into the D.C. Metro station with a handful of people from the International Space Station Conference. Our conversation paused as we approached a mother struggling to balance a two-seat stroller on the escalator, her toddler son trailing behind. A man from my group offered his hand to the toddler and they rode down the escalator together. As I watched the mother ferry her children into the train car, it struck me that the boy would never know he'd been helped down an escalator by a man who had piloted a spacecraft.

Johns Hopkins responds to Ebola As of April 8, 2015, the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus has claimed more than 10,000 lives, primarily in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. There have been nearly 23,000 reported or suspected cases of the disease. In response to this rapidly evolving public health crisis, Johns Hopkins experts convened in early October to discuss experimental medical countermeasures, recommendations to prevent the spread of the disease, and the complex ethical decisions that need to be made in real-time. Since then, Johns Hopkins experts have worked together to design a prototype protective suit for health workers who treat Ebola patients, and our faculty members have actively worked with the media to share their knowledge about the spread and treatment of the virus.

How protective gear is removed poses risk of deadly Ebola exposure Physical and emotional fatigue are factors in 'inadvertent' contamination By Mark Guidera / Published Sept 9, 2014 A team of American infectious disease and critical care experts is alerting colleagues caring for Ebola patients that how they remove their personal protective gear can be just as crucial as wearing it to prevent exposure to the deadly virus. In a commentary published online on Aug. 26 in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the physician-specialists from Johns Hopkins and the University of North Carolina say rigorous steps exist‚Äîand must be taken‚Äîto avoid "inadvertent" contact of frontline caregivers' exposed skin and mucous membranes to infected body fluids.

Five common questions about Ebola Learn the facts about Ebola's symptoms and how it spreads By Hub staff report / Published Oct 17, 2014 The World Health Organization recently reported that there have been nearly 9,000 cases and 5,000 deaths from Ebola virus in seven countries. The outbreak‚Äîcentered in the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea‚Äîhas rapidly become a public health crisis, with the CDC estimating that 1.4 million could become infected in Liberia and Sierra Leone by January. On Oct. 7, the first patient diagnosed with Ebola virus outside of Africa, Thomas Eric Duncan, died at a hospital in Dallas, Texas. Duncan, 42, contracted Ebola in Liberia before traveling to Dallas, where he was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept. 28.

Berman Institute bioethicists answer Ebola-related questions Outbreak of virus in West Africa raises complex ethical challenges By Hub staff report / Published Oct 23, 2014 As the Ebola virus continues to spread across West Africa, complex ethical challenges abound related to the use of untested interventions, quarantines, special care, and other issues. Faculty members from the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics recently shared their thoughts on some of these difficult questions. Should there be a travel ban from Ebola-infected countries? Holly Taylor, Berman Institute core faculty: No. There is no evidence that travel bans have been effective in limiting the spread of infectious disease in any previous infectious disease outbreak and it is unlikely that any such ban on Ebola-infected countries will limit the spread of Ebola. Indeed our attention should be on how best to help Ebola-infected countries where the outbreak is raging rather than spending any human

And limited robotic automation is already used in surgeries involving rigid structures such as bones. But can a robot handle the slips and squirms of soft tissues during a surgery? Simon Leonard, a Johns Hopkins University computer scientist, is part of a team that has published research showing that a robot surgeon can indeed adjust to the subtle movement and deformation of soft tissue to execute precise and consistent suturing. The research, which was published earlier this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine, promises to improve results for patients and make the best surgical techniques more widely available.

How Johns Hopkins doctors helped bring CPR to the mainstream By Hub staff report / Published Nov 8, 2013 Until 1960, the only way to treat cardiac arrest was for the surgeon to open a patient's chest and, holding the heart in his or her hands, squeeze blood to vital organs. Then, a group of surgeons at Johns Hopkins forever changed the standard emergency room routine. The surgeons, who had also developed the external cardiac defibrillator, tried a new CPR technique called closed-chest cardiac massage‚Äîpumping the arrested heart without surgically opening the chest. They reported that they were able to successfully resuscitate every one of the first 20 patients they treated; 14 of those patients survived without brain damage. Soon after the Johns Hopkins doctors reported their success, closed-chest cardiac massage crept into the mainstream, becoming the go-to procedure for all cardiac arrests in U.S. hospitals.

Often the interventional radiologists who perform these important procedures must try several times in order to successfully stop the bleeding. A team of students from Johns Hopkins University's Department of Materials Science and Engineering has developed a "super gel" that has the potential to eventually make this process easier, less expensive, and more efficient. The gel can pass through a catheter‚Äîthe delivery vehicle of choice‚Äîbut is hyper-absorbent enough to then swell with blood, creating a clot

As one walks by the building, with each step the reflection alters like a kaleidoscope being turned. Inch closer, and the view adjusts further still, picking up details not visible before, like a sculpture or plant in the distance. On the other side of the glass, pure science comes into view. Starting here this fall, Johns Hopkins undergraduates will analyze enzymes, culture cells, and conduct other lab work intended to reinforce concepts introduced in lecture courses, and as a platform to scientific discovery that might lead to the next great breakthrough.

North Ave., the century-old building about a mile south of the Johns Hopkins Homewood campus whose sleek (if somewhat battered) moderne facade of contrasting travertine and soapstone dates to the 1939 opening of the erstwhile Centre Theatre here. The voluminous, three-story structure between Charles and St. Paul streets had begun life as a garage for Packards and Studebakers and in the late 1950s was ignobly carved up into banking offices. Then came vacancy and decay. Image caption: Thomas Dolby, the first Homewood Professor of the Arts, in the former Center Theatre, which next fall will house the Johns Hopkins‚ÄìMICA Film Center.

Johns Hopkins offers new major in medicine, science, humanities By Kate Pipkin / Published March-April 2015 The Krieger School of Arts and Sciences has launched the medicine, science, and humanities major for students who want to examine medical and scientific issues through the lens of humanities studies. The new interdisciplinary major gives Johns Hopkins undergraduates the chance to pursue the natural sciences and the humanities, rather than having to choose one or the other. Beverly Wendland, interim dean of the Krieger School, says the major was created in part to help close the polarizing gap between the sciences and the humanities. "Given our academic strengths, Johns Hopkins is ideally suited to create a course of undergraduate concentration that focuses on the intersection of medicine, science, and the humanities," Wendland says. "In the rapidly changing landscape of higher education in the 21st century, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to promote intellectual innovations

Researchers begin to unravel complex medical mysteries using digital tools Computational medicine enhances the way doctors detect, treat disease By Phil Sneiderman / Published Nov 5, 2012 Computational medicine, a fast-growing method of using computer models and sophisticated software to figure out how disease develops‚Äîand how to thwart it‚Äîhas begun to leap off the drawing board and land in the hands of doctors who treat patients for heart ailments, cancer, and other illnesses. Using digital tools, researchers have begun to use experimental and clinical data to build models that can unravel complex medical mysteries. These are some of the conclusions of a new review of the field published in the Oct. 31 issue of the journal Science Translational Medicine. The article, "Computational Medicine: Translating Models to Clinical Care," was written by four Johns Hopkins professors affiliated with the university's Institute for Computational Medicine.

Bloomberg's past support for the university is detailed here. Capital and Infrastructure In all, the mayor has given $240 million toward capital and infrastructure projects, including the Bloomberg Center for Physics and Astronomy in 1988, implementation of the Homewood campus master plan from 1998 through 2002, massive renovations and improvements at the Peabody Institute in 2000, and a complete gutting and interior rebuilding of the landmark Gilman Hall at Homewood from 2005 to 2007.

Nasr, author of the forthcoming book "The Dispensable Nation: American Foreign Policy in Retreat," suggests that now is the time for the U.S. and Iran to meet at the bargaining table to discuss Iran's nuclear ambition and make real progress toward a resolution. But in order for that to happen, Nasr writes, the U.S. must turn from a policy marked by sanctions and intimidation. Economic sanctions are biting hard in Iran.

Nasr: Iran's presidential elections a 'game-changer' for U.S.-Iran relations Decisive win by reformist candidate gives Obama an opening By Hub staff report / Published June 18, 2013 Vali Nasr, dean of the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, writes in a blog entry for Foreign Policy magazine that a decisive victory by moderate Hassan Rowhani in Iran's presidential elections is a "game-changer" for relations between the U.S. and Iran. Rowhani, described as a mid-mannered cleric, won 50.7% of the vote in a six-way race to replace departing leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose tenure, The New York Times wrote, "was defined largely by confrontation with the West and a seriously hobbled economy at home." In an interview with NPR's Melissa Block, Nasr spoke about the significance of Rowhani's election. "The message is that people of Iran are repudiating the legacy of Ahmadinejad," he said. "And that's quite important; that the Iranian

Researchers explore use of light to correct life-threatening arrhythmias Treatment seen as gentler alternative to jolts delivered by defibrillators By Phil Sneiderman / Published Aug 28, 2013 When a beating heart slips into an irregular, life-threatening rhythm, the treatment is well known: deliver a burst of electric current from a pacemaker or defibrillator. But because the electricity itself can cause pain, tissue damage, and other serious side-effects, a Johns Hopkins-led research team wants to replace these jolts with a kinder, gentler remedy: light.

The model of city institutions and communities working together towards shared goals is one that Daniels has experience with from his days at the University of Pennsylvania, The Sun notes, and one that can and should be emulated in Baltimore. The $10 million is certainly significant, but of more lasting‚Äîand replicable‚Äîimportance is the structure for collaboration that preceded it. As important as Hopkins has been to the city, it has not always been trusted. The process by which the Homewood Community Partners Initiative was developed‚Äîhundreds of

Daniels acknowledges the challenges brought on by a half-century of urban decline‚Äînot just in Baltimore, but in urban centers across the country‚Äîbut sees a city poised for a 21st century renaissance. "In a city such as Baltimore, it is not hard to see the decay," Daniels writes.

Commentary: Blame biased policies and politics, not black culture By Hub staff report / Published May 1, 2015 Nathan Connolly, an assistant professor of history at Johns Hopkins University, writes about the economics behind the recent unrest in Baltimore in today's issue of The New York Times. In "Black Culture Is Not the Problem," Connolly asserts that "policy and politics" played a larger role in the events that unfolded earlier this week in Baltimore than did some shortcoming of black culture. From The Times: Specifically, the problem rests on the continued profitability of racism. Freddie Gray's exposure to lead paint as a child, his suspected participation in the drug trade, and the relative confinement of black unrest to black communities during this week's riot are all features of a city and a country that still segregate people along racial lines, to the financial enrichment of landlords, corner store merchants and

Many 'deadbeat dads' support children through gifts, not cash, study shows By Jill Rosen / Published June 15, 2015 Low-income fathers who might be labeled "deadbeat dads" often spend as much on their children as parents in formal child-support arrangements, but they choose to give goods like food and clothing rather than cash, a Johns Hopkins-led study found. In the first examination of the magnitude of in-kind child support, published this month in the Journal of Marriage and Family, the team found many disadvantaged noncustodial fathers spend an average of $60 a month on in-kind provisions, while dads paying formal child support spend about $38 a month. Men who were the most disadvantaged tended to give a higher proportion of their support in gifts, the study found.

JHU's Community Impact Internships program honored for service contributions Program among recipients of Governor's Service Award By Rachel Chism / Published Oct 26, 2015 Johns Hopkins University's Community Impact Internships Program has been awarded a Governor's Service Award for Exemplary Service Learning, an honor that recognizes sustained commitment to community needs. The award will be presented at a ceremony today at the Miller Senate Office Building in Annapolis, Maryland. The program, administered by the university's Center for Social Concern, pairs students with Baltimore nonprofits and government agencies to work on community-identified projects for two months at no cost to the organizations themselves. During the summer, 50 students spread across the city to 48 different grassroots and community organizations to work 30 hours each week. Scott Gottbreht, director of United Way of Central Maryland's Project Homeless, nominated the group for their volunteer service during 2014. His organization has hosted interns for

Luke Shaefer, '$2.00 A Day: Living on Almost Nothing in America' By Katie Pearce / Published Nov 10, 2015 Though her new book about the lowest depths of American poverty doesn't focus on Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University social scientist Kathryn Edin says it's "very much a Baltimore story." The book, $2.00 A Day: Living on Almost Nothing in America, was inspired in part by a group of young adults who grew up in Baltimore's high-rise public housing projects, Edin said at a reading Monday night at Mason Hall on JHU's Homewood campus. Edin and her research team from Harvard had first visited the families in the 1990s, and returned in 2010, "post‚Äìwelfare reform," she said, to check in on how the youngest
