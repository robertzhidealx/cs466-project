Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece. The first public film showing in the U.S. took place. The London Daily Mail was founded. Henry Ford drove his first Ford car through the streets. Most importantly, in 1896, The News-Letter started.This year The News-Letter is celebrating its quasquicentennial. Things have changed a lot at the paper, even over just the past year, and we wanted to take time to celebrate that here in this magazine. So we invited back the people who know The News-Letter best: our past editors, writers, cartoonists, business members and everyone in between. Past editors had interviews

As freshmen, you witnessed the election of one of our country’s most controversial presidents and a subsequent outpour of activism within the student body. Many of you marched alongside friends, family and millions of strangers worldwide in the first Women’s March. Four years later, this commitment to equity is more important than ever as you graduate into a pandemic and a recession — a time of unprecedented uncertainty. Life at Hopkins has drastically changed throughout your time here. You were the last year to have covered grades, but you were also the last class to endure life in the AMRs without air conditioning. You’ve seen endings like the end of legacy admissions —

Thank you from The News-Letter Back to The News-Letter 2021 Commencement Magazine To all graduating students: Well, that was certainly unexpected.Starting off 2020, you probably weren’t ready for so many curveballs. Most obviously, a global pandemic turned all our in-person lectures into Zoom calls, moving our desks from our classrooms to our bedrooms. Some of you graduates pulled all-nighters every night to take classes from the other side of the world, while others here in Baltimore were made to spit into little plastic vials three times a week to be allowed on campus. And while all this was happening, you witnessed (and often participated in) a presidential election, protests and political unrest during one of the most hectic and inconsistent years in the Univeristy’s history.But even before your senior year,

You began college dozing off in lecture halls, spent a large chunk chilling at home in breakout rooms with cameras off and then finally returned to campus for your last year. If you never hear the phrases “during these unprecedented times” and “twice-weekly testing” again, it will be too soon.Despite it all, your resilience and determination are evident in how you’ve made the best of your time here at Hopkins. You’ve filled out the Marriage Pact then promptly ghosted your match, made it to the reopening of the Ralph S.

You’ve undeniably had an unorthodox college experience: What was supposed to be the ordinary, best-four-years-of-your-life experience was turned into a demanding journey. But you have all prevailed. We hope that the past year filled with in-person courses, live performances and exploring Baltimore with friends has made up for it! Besides attending college during a pandemic, you went through midterms, finals, papers and theses this year alone and came out on top. Never again will you have to pull another Brody Learning Commons (BLC) all-nighter, try to sneak into Hopkins Cafe as an upperclassman or complain

EXAMINING HOPKINS HOSPITAL'S RELATIONSHIP WITH BALTIMORE
The Johns Hopkins News-Letter EXAMINING HOPKINS HOSPITAL'S RELATIONSHIP WITH BALTIMORE Home (current) History & Legacy Ongoing Advocacy Back to The News-Letter EXAMINING HOPKINS HOSPITAL'S RELATIONSHIP WITH BALTIMORE Letter from the Editors Dear Readers, When COVID-19 began to spread across the globe, the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center emerged as a key source of information for the public, solidifying the University’s position as a leader in public health. However, beneath this image, Hopkins is also an institution that has historically mistreated the communities of color that surround it. Most of us are familiar with the ways in which the University has failed Black Baltimoreans. In 1951, Hopkins Hospital took samples of Henrietta Lacks’ cells without her consent, paving the way for later advances in medicine, yet at the cost of exploiting a Black patient. In 1993, the Kennedy Krieger Institute conducted a controversial study on the health effects of lead paint

A few months into the academic year, classes went online, students left campus and the year spiraled from there. Rather than dwell on the many low points of this year though, we asked our writers and editors to search for the things that have brought them JOY recently. For many, joy has been elusive, or even nonexistent at times, which is why we’ve chosen to gather it in this magazine. Here you’ll find it in many forms: in music, in food, in childhood memories, in small moments of day-to-day life. We hope that when you read these articles, they will also spark joy (hello Marie Kondo) for at least a few moments. If we haven’t inspired you to pick up a new hobby, return to an old
