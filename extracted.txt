About the Hub;About the Hub                 | Hub;
About the Hub We’ve been doing some thinking — quite a bit, actually — about all the things that go on at Johns Hopkins. Discovering the glue that holds the universe together, for example. Or unraveling the mysteries of Alzheimer’s disease. Or studying butterflies in flight to fine-tune the construction of aerial surveillance robots. Heady stuff, and a lot of it. In fact, Johns Hopkins does so much, in so many places, that it’s hard to wrap your brain around it all. It’s too big, too disparate, too far-flung. We created the Hub to be the news center for all this diverse, decentralized activity, a place where you can see what’s new, what’s important, what Johns Hopkins is up to that’s worth sharing. It’s where smart people (like you) can learn about all the smart stuff going on here. At the Hub, you might read about cutting-edge cancer research or

Today's Announcements FAQ Today’s Announcements is an overview of Johns Hopkins University announcements and events that is delivered to the inboxes of more than 6,500 faculty and staff (primarily at the university’s Homewood, Keswick, Eastern, and Mount Washington locations) each weekday. Note that at this time, Today’s Announcements emails are not being delivered to students. The messages include timely information from the Hub’s existing announcements digest and events listings. What is the difference between an event and an announcement? An event is something that happens on a specific date at a specific time in a specific place—concerts, speakers, theater performances, symposia. Generally, events are open to anyone in the Johns Hopkins community (and sometimes to people who aren’t affiliated with the university). An announcement is something more general that you want people around the university to know about—a new program or resource on campus, an ongoing canned food drive, or

About Johns Hopkins Magazine The first issue of Johns Hopkins Magazine landed in readers’ mailboxes in 1950, marking the birth of a new kind of magazine. Published for the graduates, faculty, and friends of America’s first research university, it was conceived to give readers “intellectual nourishment,” and over the years has featured thought-provoking and sometimes controversial articles on particle physics, student unrest, solitary confinement, artificial intelligence, and trailblazing artists. Today, we honor the magazine’s original mission while also adapting to a new world and an even broader audience. Our award-winning quarterly publication is now mailed to more than 140,000 Johns Hopkins graduates, faculty, and friends, and viewed online around the globe. We seek to forge an emotional connection with our readers, strengthening their bond with and pride in the university. Johns Hopkins remains one of the nation’s premier centers of learning, research, and discovery—sharing knowledge to better the world. The
