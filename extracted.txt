About the Hub We’ve been doing some thinking — quite a bit, actually — about all the things that go on at Johns Hopkins. Discovering the glue that holds the universe together, for example. Or unraveling the mysteries of Alzheimer’s disease. Or studying butterflies in flight to fine-tune the construction of aerial surveillance robots. Heady stuff, and a lot of it. In fact, Johns Hopkins does so much, in so many places, that it’s hard to wrap your brain around it all. It’s too big, too disparate, too far-flung. We created the Hub to be the news center for all this diverse, decentralized activity, a place where you can see what’s new, what’s important, what Johns Hopkins is up to that’s worth sharing.

Summer Gigs Out of this world: Working on the International Space Station project Hopkins students tell us what they're up to during summer break By Sophia Porter / Published Aug 7, 2017 I stepped into the D.C. Metro station with a handful of people from the International Space Station Conference. Our conversation paused as we approached a mother struggling to balance a two-seat stroller on the escalator, her toddler son trailing behind. A man from my group offered his hand to the toddler and they rode down the escalator together. As I watched the mother ferry her children into the train car, it struck me that the boy would never know he'd been helped down an escalator by a man who had piloted a spacecraft.

Johns Hopkins responds to Ebola As of April 8, 2015, the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus has claimed more than 10,000 lives, primarily in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. There have been nearly 23,000 reported or suspected cases of the disease. In response to this rapidly evolving public health crisis, Johns Hopkins experts convened in early October to discuss experimental medical countermeasures, recommendations to prevent the spread of the disease, and the complex ethical decisions that need to be made in real-time. Since then, Johns Hopkins experts have worked together to design a prototype protective suit for health workers who treat Ebola patients, and our faculty members have actively worked with the media to share their knowledge about the spread and treatment of the virus.

Participants from across the university will be asked to help improve the design of personal protection gear that health workers wear and use while treating patients who are infected with the Ebola virus by developing new protective gear and improving procedures to reduce the risk of exposure. The disease, which has a fatality rate of more than 50 percent, can be transmitted from person to person by close contact with patients, dead bodies, or infected bodily fluids.

How protective gear is removed poses risk of deadly Ebola exposure Physical and emotional fatigue are factors in 'inadvertent' contamination By Mark Guidera / Published Sept 9, 2014 A team of American infectious disease and critical care experts is alerting colleagues caring for Ebola patients that how they remove their personal protective gear can be just as crucial as wearing it to prevent exposure to the deadly virus. In a commentary published online on Aug. 26 in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the physician-specialists from Johns Hopkins and the University of North Carolina say rigorous steps exist—and must be taken—to avoid "inadvertent" contact of frontline caregivers' exposed skin and mucous membranes to infected body fluids. Personal protective equipment, including goggles or face shields, gloves and gowns, are effectively decreasing West African caregivers' exposure to infected bodily fluids, but workers are still at risk "if removal of protective clothing that is

Five common questions about Ebola Learn the facts about Ebola's symptoms and how it spreads By Hub staff report / Published Oct 17, 2014 The World Health Organization recently reported that there have been nearly 9,000 cases and 5,000 deaths from Ebola virus in seven countries. The outbreak—centered in the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea—has rapidly become a public health crisis, with the CDC estimating that 1.4 million could become infected in Liberia and Sierra Leone by January. On Oct. 7, the first patient diagnosed with Ebola virus outside of Africa, Thomas Eric Duncan, died at a hospital in Dallas, Texas. Duncan, 42, contracted Ebola in Liberia before traveling to Dallas, where he was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Sept. 28. Two nurses who cared for him were subsequently diagnosed with Ebola. Featured CoverageJohns Hopkins responds to EbolaRelevant news coverage and helpful resources related

Berman Institute bioethicists answer Ebola-related questions Outbreak of virus in West Africa raises complex ethical challenges By Hub staff report / Published Oct 23, 2014 As the Ebola virus continues to spread across West Africa, complex ethical challenges abound related to the use of untested interventions, quarantines, special care, and other issues. Faculty members from the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics recently shared their thoughts on some of these difficult questions. Should there be a travel ban from Ebola-infected countries? Holly Taylor, Berman Institute core faculty: No. There is no evidence that travel bans have been effective in limiting the spread of infectious disease in any previous infectious disease outbreak and it is unlikely that any such ban on Ebola-infected countries will limit the spread of Ebola. Indeed our attention should be on how best to help Ebola-infected countries where the outbreak is raging rather than spending any human

And limited robotic automation is already used in surgeries involving rigid structures such as bones. But can a robot handle the slips and squirms of soft tissues during a surgery? Simon Leonard, a Johns Hopkins University computer scientist, is part of a team that has published research showing that a robot surgeon can indeed adjust to the subtle movement and deformation of soft tissue to execute precise and consistent suturing. The research, which was published earlier this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine, promises to improve results for patients and make the best surgical techniques more widely available.

How Johns Hopkins doctors helped bring CPR to the mainstream By Hub staff report / Published Nov 8, 2013 Until 1960, the only way to treat cardiac arrest was for the surgeon to open a patient's chest and, holding the heart in his or her hands, squeeze blood to vital organs. Then, a group of surgeons at Johns Hopkins forever changed the standard emergency room routine. The surgeons, who had also developed the external cardiac defibrillator, tried a new CPR technique called closed-chest cardiac massage—pumping the arrested heart without surgically opening the chest. They reported that they were able to successfully resuscitate every one of the first 20 patients they treated; 14 of those patients survived without brain damage. Soon after the Johns Hopkins doctors reported their success, closed-chest cardiac massage crept into the mainstream, becoming the go-to procedure for all cardiac arrests in U.S. hospitals.

For the study, investigators from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania surveyed and tracked the activities of thousands of first-year residents in 63 internal medicine training programs nationwide.

Often the interventional radiologists who perform these important procedures must try several times in order to successfully stop the bleeding. A team of students from Johns Hopkins University's Department of Materials Science and Engineering has developed a "super gel" that has the potential to eventually make this process easier, less expensive, and more efficient. The gel can pass through a catheter—the delivery vehicle of choice—but is hyper-absorbent enough to then swell with blood, creating a clot

The ability to create hydrogels on demand, they say, could advance the effort to study elusive cell structures that form in nature under certain conditions—and to uncover how these structures contribute to human diseases. Too many or too few natural hydrogels could affect a cell's ability to function, and may be linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Lou Gehrig's disease.

The majority of the new gift, $250 million out of $350 million, will be part of a larger effort to raise $1 billion to facilitate cross-disciplinary work across the university to galvanize people, resources, research and educational opportunities around a set of complex global challenges. Initially, the funds will be used to support the appointment of faculty in the areas of

New members wanted: Student groups court Hopkins newcomers at annual Student Involvement Fair By Hub staff report / Published Sept 4, 2015 At Johns Hopkins University, there's a club for almost anybody. From the Hopkins Honeybees—a group that educates the community about the environmental necessity of bees—to the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu team and the Cubing Association (for Rubik's Cube masters), it's easy for students to find their niche. The difficult part is choosing which one (two, three, or maybe even four) to join. On Friday, Hopkins organizations gathered at the O'Connor Recreation Center for the seventh annual Student Involvement Fair, aiming to recruit new members. The fair, hosted by Student Leadership and Involvement, included representatives from an estimated 240 of JHU's more than 300 undergraduate student organizations.

As one walks by the building, with each step the reflection alters like a kaleidoscope being turned. Inch closer, and the view adjusts further still, picking up details not visible before, like a sculpture or plant in the distance. On the other side of the glass, pure science comes into view. Starting here this fall, Johns Hopkins undergraduates will analyze enzymes, culture cells, and conduct other lab work intended to reinforce concepts introduced in lecture courses, and as a platform to scientific discovery that might lead to the next great breakthrough.

Three Mellon grants will support music, arts, humanities By Kate Pipkin / Published June 2013 Johns Hopkins University has been awarded three grants from the Andrew W.

A grant for $1.2 million will be used to engage bridge professors—jointly appointed by the Krieger School and Peabody—who will, in time, form the core of a faculty embedded in humanities and social science departments, with interests in aspects of music. These scholars will create a new music major that will capitalize on the rich resources in performance, music theory, and musicology at Peabody and in the historical, cultural, and scientific study of music at the Krieger School.

Johns Hopkins, MICA put down roots in Station North Arts and Entertainment District By Brennen Jensen / Published Nov-Dec 2014 It's noisy and dusty up on the second floor of 10 E. North Ave., the century-old building about a mile south of the Johns Hopkins Homewood campus whose sleek (if somewhat battered) moderne facade of contrasting travertine and soapstone dates to the 1939 opening of the erstwhile Centre Theatre here. The voluminous, three-story structure between Charles and St. Paul streets had begun life as a garage for Packards and Studebakers and in the late 1950s was ignobly carved up into banking offices. Then came vacancy and decay. Image caption: Thomas Dolby, the first Homewood Professor of the Arts, in the former Center Theatre, which next fall will house the Johns Hopkins–MICA Film Center.

Johns Hopkins offers new major in medicine, science, humanities By Kate Pipkin / Published March-April 2015 The Krieger School of Arts and Sciences has launched the medicine, science, and humanities major for students who want to examine medical and scientific issues through the lens of humanities studies. The new interdisciplinary major gives Johns Hopkins undergraduates the chance to pursue the natural sciences and the humanities, rather than having to choose one or the other. Beverly Wendland, interim dean of the Krieger School, says the major was created in part to help close the polarizing gap between the sciences and the humanities. "Given our academic strengths, Johns Hopkins is ideally suited to create a course of undergraduate concentration that focuses on the intersection of medicine, science, and the humanities," Wendland says. "In the rapidly changing landscape of higher education in the 21st century, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to promote intellectual innovations

Researchers begin to unravel complex medical mysteries using digital tools Computational medicine enhances the way doctors detect, treat disease By Phil Sneiderman / Published Nov 5, 2012 Computational medicine, a fast-growing method of using computer models and sophisticated software to figure out how disease develops—and how to thwart it—has begun to leap off the drawing board and land in the hands of doctors who treat patients for heart ailments, cancer, and other illnesses. Using digital tools, researchers have begun to use experimental and clinical data to build models that can unravel complex medical mysteries. These are some of the conclusions of a new review of the field published in the Oct. 31 issue of the journal Science Translational Medicine. The article, "Computational Medicine: Translating Models to Clinical Care," was written by four Johns Hopkins professors affiliated with the university's Institute for Computational Medicine. The institute was launched in 2005 as

Bloomberg announced a gift of $350 million to Johns Hopkins University in January, it brought his overall financial support for the university to more than $1 billion, a sum that is believed to be the most from a single donor to an institution of higher education. Bloomberg's past support for the university is detailed here. Capital and Infrastructure In all, the mayor has given $240 million toward capital and infrastructure projects, including the Bloomberg Center for Physics and Astronomy in 1988, implementation of the Homewood campus master plan from 1998 through 2002, massive renovations and improvements at the Peabody Institute in 2000, and a complete gutting and interior rebuilding of the landmark Gilman Hall at Homewood from 2005 to 2007.

Nasr, author of the forthcoming book "The Dispensable Nation: American Foreign Policy in Retreat," suggests that now is the time for the U.S. and Iran to meet at the bargaining table to discuss Iran's nuclear ambition and make real progress toward a resolution. But in order for that to happen, Nasr writes, the U.S. must turn from a policy marked by sanctions and intimidation. Economic sanctions are biting hard in Iran.

Rowhani, described as a mid-mannered cleric, won 50.7% of the vote in a six-way race to replace departing leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose tenure, The New York Times wrote, "was defined largely by confrontation with the West and a seriously hobbled economy at home." In an interview with NPR's Melissa Block, Nasr spoke about the significance of Rowhani's election. "The message is that people of Iran are repudiating the legacy of Ahmadinejad," he said.

Unlikely activist: Edith Windsor successfully challenged Defense of Marriage Act She will be one of seven 2014 Johns Hopkins honorary degree recipients By Joe Sugarman / Published May 1, 2014 Edith Windsor never thought she'd one day become a hero for the gay rights movement. But when her spouse—Thea Spyer, whom she had married legally in Canada—died, Windsor sued the U.S. government in 2010 for $363,053, the amount she had to pay in estate taxes after Spyer's death. Under the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman, Windsor was not entitled to the federal estate tax exemption for surviving spouses. When the Supreme Court decided 5-4 in Windsor's favor last June, it declared that DOMA violated the U.S. Constitution by barring legally married, same-sex couples from enjoying the benefits of marriage conferred under federal law. The decision marked the first

Three months later, in a 5-4 decision, the justices agreed. The court's ruling in United States vs. Windsor overturned section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, which had excluded gay couples from more than 1,100 federal provisions, such as filing taxes jointly, claiming Social Security survivor benefits, and—in the case of Kaplan's client, Edith Windsor—claiming the federal estate tax exemption for surviving spouses.

Daniels: Urban universities can transform local communities By Hub staff report / Published Feb 27, 2013 The new issue of SAISPHERE, which explores the theme "Cities Lead the Way for Global Change," includes an essay from President Ronald J. Daniels about the vital role Johns Hopkins will play in strengthening Baltimore now and in the future. "No longer islands of privilege in a sea of need," the essay's subheadline reads, "urban universities are using their talent and treasure to transform local communities." Daniels acknowledges the challenges brought on by a half-century of urban decline—not just in Baltimore, but in urban centers across the country—but sees a city poised for a 21st century renaissance. "In a city such as Baltimore, it is not hard to see the decay," Daniels writes. "Today, Baltimore is one of the most crime-ridden cities in America, and its poverty rate is more than double the statewide

"Baltimore has pent-up energy and anger," Spence wrote. "The routine actions of the police combined with the derision and casual disdain expressed by many political officials made what happened almost predestined."

Commentary: Blame biased policies and politics, not black culture By Hub staff report / Published May 1, 2015 Nathan Connolly, an assistant professor of history at Johns Hopkins University, writes about the economics behind the recent unrest in Baltimore in today's issue of The New York Times. In "Black Culture Is Not the Problem," Connolly asserts that "policy and politics" played a larger role in the events that unfolded earlier this week in Baltimore than did some shortcoming of black culture. From The Times: Specifically, the problem rests on the continued profitability of racism. Freddie Gray's exposure to lead paint as a child, his suspected participation in the drug trade, and the relative confinement of black unrest to black communities during this week's riot are all features of a city and a country that still segregate people along racial lines, to the financial enrichment of landlords, corner store merchants and

Many 'deadbeat dads' support children through gifts, not cash, study shows By Jill Rosen / Published June 15, 2015 Low-income fathers who might be labeled "deadbeat dads" often spend as much on their children as parents in formal child-support arrangements, but they choose to give goods like food and clothing rather than cash, a Johns Hopkins-led study found. In the first examination of the magnitude of in-kind child support, published this month in the Journal of Marriage and Family, the team found many disadvantaged noncustodial fathers spend an average of $60 a month on in-kind provisions, while dads paying formal child support spend about $38 a month. Men who were the most disadvantaged tended to give a higher proportion of their support in gifts, the study found. "The most disadvantaged dads end up looking like they're completely distanced from their kids but they're actually giving quite a lot," said co-author

A. T. As many people who have been to college will tell you, these are three of the most anxiety-inducing letters of the English alphabet. Administered by the College Board, a century-old "not-for-profit that connects students to college success and opportunity," the Scholastic Assessment Test is designed to evaluate students' college readiness. And, as was announced earlier this month, it's about to undergo a major revision. The SAT is currently made up of several sections, including critical reading, mathematics, and writing. From start to finish, including breaks, the SAT takes about four and a half hours to sit through. Because of the rigid timing and the mental gymnastics some of the problems require—for

CTY director makes case for new perspective on higher ed 'undermatching' Hansen: Finding a good fit should be priority from preK forward By Hub staff report / Published Feb 26, 2014 The concept of "undermatching"—broadly, the idea that low-income students often end up at colleges that are beneath them, academically speaking—has become a hot topic in education of late. Image caption: Elaine Tuttle Hansen Image credit: CADE MARTIN There is concern that, for a variety of reasons, these students aren't aiming as high as they should be. And as researchers are wont to do when they see the phenomenon of privilege at work, many are studying undermatching to find out how best to address it. Some academics think "undermatching is overrated," and accuse undermatching researchers of being "overconfident" and overstating their conclusions.

Edin and her research team from Harvard had first visited the families in the 1990s, and returned in 2010, "post–welfare reform," she said, to check in on how the youngest
