 2023–2024 NBA awards: It keeps getting tougher - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By JOSH FELTON                                                     | April 23, 2024
With the NBA regular season ending last week, it’s time to make my annual award selections. This year, the NBA made award selections positionless, which in theory should make it easier for voters to make a decision. But does it? Does this put guards at a disadvantage to earn the most prestigious defensive awards? How does the minimum games requirement help or hurt the cases of deserving candidates who decided to play through injury to meet the threshold? Here are my selections. Rookie of the Year: Victor Wembanyama (San Antonio Spurs) This might be the easiest selection of all. Wembanyama is having one of the greatest rookie seasons we’ve ever seen. He became the first rookie to score 1,500 points, block at least 250 shots and hit 100 3-point shots in a single season. His 21.4 points per game and 10.6 rebounds is the highest for a rookie in over

 2022–2023 NBA awards selections are even tougher than last year - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

With just under a week remaining in the regular season, the time has come to make selections for the league’s most prestigious awards. Last year, I gave my opinion on those who were the most deserving candidates for each award, noting that it was one of the toughest decisions I’ve ever had to make. This year has been even more difficult as I anticipate many more deserving candidates being snubbed for these awards. Because of this, I've decided to change the criteria. In years past, team success has played a huge part in these awards; however, for this exercise, I will be selecting strictly the best players for each award. “Best” will denote how much a player’s production and skillset helps a random team win a championship. The only outside factor influencing my decisions will be games played. This will isolate a player’s overall impact from that of their team’s

 2021-2022 NBA awards selections: the most difficult decisions ever   - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

The 2021-2022 NBA Season has officially come to an end, and for the first time in years the basketball community is in disaccord. In the past two years, the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award and the Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY) were pretty straightforward for most fans, reporters and voters alike. This season, however, the parity is at an all-time high. Multiple people have a legitimate claim to virtually every single award, and the playoffs are almost certain to be legendary. In what was easily the toughest awards ballot I’ve had to complete, here are my selections for each award. Rookie of the Year: Cade Cunningham (Detroit Pistons) Cunningham has been one of the most exciting players — not just rookies, but players — to watch this season. His versatility on the offense and his phenomenal vision make him one of the most promising young players in the league

 2024 NFL draft: Five of the best first round fits - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By FREDDY BRANSON                                                     | April 24, 2024
The 2024 NFL draft is just around the corner, and with that comes a massive amount of predictions and projections — a lot of which will likely turn out incorrect. With this in mind, I will go through a few of my favorite landing spots for some of the top players in this draft class and discuss just how I think they can be implemented in order to flourish at the next level. 1. Pick 9 Chicago Bears: Rome Odunze WR, University of Washington The Bears have found themselves in an incredible position going into this year’s draft — holding two top-ten picks (including the first overall pick) in what is projected to be one of the most loaded drafts in years. After trading Justin Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers, their first pick should already be made with Caleb Williams, the quarterback that is seen to be the best prospect

2024 NFL mock draft: Quarterbacks and tackles dominate the first round - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

With the NFL Draft beginning this Thursday, we have one last opportunity to look at the possibilities that could unfold and to delve into a bit of the chaos. A lot of these teams have already been “locked in” to take certain players; however, if previous drafts are anything to go by, there will most certainly be some crazy moves that occur, so it’s best to take these mock drafts merely as a thought experiment rather than gospel. I’ll be giving some of my thoughts on the first 15 picks and then going through what I believe will transpire throughout the rest of the first round. Pick 1: Chicago Bears (traded from Carolina Panthers): Caleb Williams QB, University of Southern California There’s not much that needs to be said about Williams other than the fact that he has been penciled in for this pick for nearly two years now. Williams

Let’s set the scene: the sun begins shining a bit brighter each day, and the temperature climbs to a nice 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Sidewalks are no longer riddled with ice, and the once bare trees are now covered with lush green leaves. As cities awaken from their winter slumbers, so do runners. The longer daylight hours invite runners to lace up their shoes and find rhythm in their feet once again. I, among other runners, like to line up the spring season with a selection of road races. This spring’s highlight takes a zoom into the Cherry Blossom 10-Miler, a beloved race that draws elite fields right into the heart of Washington, D.C. And so, every year at the peak of the cherry blossom bloom, runners of all kinds awaken from their hibernation to rediscover a vibrant running community gathered near the Washington Monument at a chilly 6:30 a.m. Big

 Breaking knowledge barriers: The need for open-access in science - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By SHREYA TIWARI                                                     | April 22, 2024
The internet serves as a haven of scientific information, representing an era where the knowledge of anything we wish to know is available at our fingertips. Yet in many ways, accurate, firsthand accessibility to scientific research and comprehensibility of scientific knowledge is severely limited. A substantial overhaul is needed in the way that the general populace accesses scientific knowledge. A key part of the problem is that a significant portion of scientific literature, including journals and press releases, is hidden behind steep paywalls. The cost to access these articles can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars, a price that is unaffordable for most individuals. This practice not only limits the dissemination of knowledge but also hampers the public's trust in science. For many university students, researchers and labs, larger institutions — such as universities and research centers — often bear the cost of these subscriptions, which mitigates part of

I’m sitting here writing my last piece for my column in The News-Letter, and I am at a loss for words. I’ve thought about this moment for a while: what I’d write in my last piece, where in my life I’d be and what closing words I’d share. While the last four years have shaped who I am and influenced who I have become, I’ve come to the realization that, at my core, I’m the same I’ve always been: discovering myself through my writing and growing from my experiences. I look back at this photo above: it’s of me sitting on Arpoador Rock in Rio de Janeiro, a place I’ve been coming to see the sunset with my family for ages. However, this past spring break, instead of coming to Rio with my family, I was here with friends from college. I was really excited for the trip, but also

Located in Hampden, Catalog Coffee could be your new favorite cafe spot! Upon entering, the earthy green atmosphere and ornaments of succulents throughout the shop create a welcoming and hospitable environment for customers. Soft but lively music plays in the background, complementing the servers grazing from table to table handing out orders and creating a bustling and cheery environment. The cafe itself is an adorable study spot, with ample lighting and seats in the back for students to pull out their laptops and notebooks. In fact, the cafe was filled with people doing work, and I easily imagined myself coming back to enjoy a coffee while studying. After studying the menu for (admittedly) way too long and concluding that everything seemed mouthwatering, we ordered a variety of sandwiches, pastries and drinks at the register. Within a few minutes, a kind waitress had already given us all of our food. The

Hopkins students and community members voiced their support for the people of Gaza and demanded that the University divest from weapons manufacturers supplying the Israeli government on Wednesday, April 24. The protest, which started at 6 p.m., was coordinated to take place alongside protests at Columbia University, Yale University, Harvard University and Rutgers University. The event was jointly organized by the Hopkins Justice Collective (HJC), the Hopkins and Bloomberg School of Public Health Students for Justice in Palestine, Hopkins Students for Palestine, the Baltimore branch of the Party for Socialism and Liberation and the Hopkins Coalition Against War. After a safety warning, opening speeches by various Hopkins affiliates included thanking protestors for attending the event to stand in solidarity with the people of Gaza.

Hello everyone, and welcome to the last week of class! As the semester wraps up and finals season creeps closer, let’s take a look at the incredible performances of our teams this past week. Men’s lacrosse: W (7–5) Our Hopkins men’s lacrosse team continued an unbeaten run in the Big Ten season by toppling fifth-ranked University of Maryland this weekend at Homewood Field. After establishing an early 3–0 lead, courtesy of graduate students Garrett Degnon and Jacob Angelus, the Blue Jays were able to hold Maryland to their lowest goal total since March 2017. With this result, Hopkins is the top seed in the Big Ten Tournament and will face the winner of the quarter final game between University of Michigan and Ohio State University. Both the semifinal games and the championship decider will be played at Ohio State. Men’s lacrosse achieved this result in front of the largest crowd

Ilil Benjamin is a senior lecturer in the Department of Sociology at Hopkins. In an interview with The News-Letter, Benjamin described her experience working in a humanitarian NGO for refugees as well as how her classes intersect with her research. The News-Letter: How did you become interested in humanitarian aid? Ilil Benjamin: I read an article about Palestinians who were living in the West Bank. American psychologists had come to do mindfulness therapy with them, supposedly to help them cope with the day-to-day difficulties of living under a military occupation. These were well-meaning psychologists who wanted to use their toolkit to provide assistance, but many Palestinians saw that as a depoliticizing act. They were worried that it would distract from larger political and social questions. I interviewed some of the psychologists later on, and [people in the West Bank] said that they don't want to be pacified, and they don't

While immunology fascinated him in high school, when Saahith Potluri entered Hopkins, he had no intention of continuing his research interests past college. Now, with graduation only weeks away, he is determined to keep his work alive in the next chapter of his life. For the past two-and-a-half years, Potluri has worked in the Calabresi Lab which studies possible treatments for Multiple Sclerosis (MS). MS is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that causes neuron inflammation and destroys the myelin sheathes protecting them. As MS progresses, it can result in extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of motor skills, loss of vision and numbness, among other symptoms. It is the most common disabling neurological disease for adults ages 20–40, and there is currently no known cure. Potluri’s work has primarily focused on NLRX1, a protein that has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory effect in combating other chronic illnesses

The Office of Leadership Engagement & Experiential Development (LEED) is committed to supporting student life and managing Registered Student Organization (RSO) activities. According to its website, the office provides services for RSOs, such as campus space reservations, financial management and mail reception. In an interview with The News-Letter, Interim Director of LEED Charles O. Norman III, who succeeded Calvin L. Smith Jr. last month, defined the main goals of the office. “Our mission is to help students grow as well-rounded individuals outside of the classroom,” he said. “I think our goal is to make sure that everyone feels supported, and we try to do our best in that.” As RSO activities returned to pre-pandemic level after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted completely, there was an increased need to utilize services provided by LEED. Students assessed how effective these services have been this academic year. A survey conducted by The News-Letter, which

The Office of Sustainability hosted the second annual Hopkins Earth Fest this past Friday, April 19 on Keyser Quad. Despite the rain, dozens of students gathered to celebrate. Stands for food, refreshments and other activities were located around the quad. Earth Fest was held in April to commemorate Earth Month by highlighting the importance of sustainability and renewability in our community. Earth Day itself took place on Monday, April 22. The event included several interactive opportunities for students, including a bike that people could pedal to blend their smoothies. Paper passports were also handed out to students at a front table. If they collected stamps from all the Earth Fest stations, they received a free plant.

The University’s Board of Trustees voted to divest its endowment from thermal coal on Friday. The vote, which was announced in a statement on Tuesday, comes almost three months after the Public Interest Investment Advisory Committee (PIIAC) recommended that the University divest from fossil fuels. PIIAC is a group of 13 undergraduates, graduate students, faculty and staff from across the University’s divisions. The recommendations were released in September following six years of campaigning from Refuel Our Future (Refuel), a student organization that has called for the University to divest from fossil fuels. Refuel hoped that the University would follow PIIAC’s recommendations to “terminate all direct investments” from Carbon Underground 200 companies (CU 200). These companies are considered leaders in the fossil fuel industry and include fossil fuels aside from coal such as oil and natural gas. Senior Atlas Elawad, the current president of Refuel, said that the Board’s decision came

In June 1976, roughly 10,000 students in Soweto, South Africa organized a peaceful protest against new legislation decreeing that Afrikaans, alongside English, be used in Soweto high schools. Afrikaans was known as the “language of the oppressor” in apartheid South Africa. Upon their peaceful march toward Orlando Stadium, the protesters were met with heavily armed police. What started off as a tear gas attack eventually turned into firing rounds of live ammunition. Hundreds of people are believed to have died and images of this police brutality spread internationally, sparking a firmer liberation movement by international forces against apartheid. Beginning in the 1970s, a student-led grassroots movement in the U.S. demanded that universities divest their holdings in South Africa. The campaign’s objective was to damage the South African economy so that the government would acquiesce to the demands of anti-Apartheid protesters nationally and internationally. Universities are often one target of divestment,

The Hopkins Board of Trustee notes are only available 25 years after they are written; therefore, only records before 1991 are available. From 1985 until 1987, Hopkins undergraduates, graduate students and a few faculty protested the University’s investment in apartheid South Africa by erecting mock shanty towns around campus under “the Coalition for a Free South Africa.” Only in the past few years have the Board of Trustees’ notes become public. They illuminate how the Board responded to student protest as well as how they reckoned with the morality of investing in a violent, white supremacist separatist state. They serve as valuable lessons for any current student activists. The Board of Trustees is charged with “exercising fiduciary responsibility for advancing Johns Hopkins’ mission and goals in a sustainable manner, through wise stewardship of all of its resources for the common good and for generations to come.” From reading the 1980s

BookTok: Trends and community - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

During and following the pandemic, reading has been on the rise. This has been evident among online communities, like and including TikTok’s “BookTok.” There, readers share book reviews, talk about their reading habits and recommend books to other TikTok users. Since then, BookTok has brought a very specific brand of reading to the forefront of mainstream pop culture. While reading had never been fully removed from pop culture, the additional leisure time people experienced while quarantining in their homes in 2020 required them to (re)discover ways to pass the time; many young people rediscovered a love of reading that stuck with them, even after life returned to normal. In particular, young women have benefited from the community cultivated by BookTok. Broadly, people who may have previously viewed reading as a solitary activity were newly able to connect with other readers over their shared interest in literature. Beyond providing an online

By MARIA HARAR                                                     | April 12, 2024
The global political order is seeing an unprecedented level of conflict with the United States being a key actor in most of them. If you think of most prominent conflicts or humanitarian crises going on today, our country, for better or for worse, has played a role. Given the current tumultuous nature of U.S. policy, both foreign and domestic, understanding why and how these policies came about is crucial and a key factor in this year’s upcoming elections. Foreign policy has been at the forefront of American politicians’ platforms since the birth of the U.S. In his farewell address, George Washington argued in favor of as little political connection as possible with foreign nations. Despite Washington’s intentions however, the 18th and 19th centuries were marked by heavy violence between the U.S. and other nations as the country focused on expansionist foreign policy and commerce. In the decades that followed, America

Elections around the globe in 2024 - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

National and regional elections are taking place in more than 50 countries around the world in 2024, including 7 of the 10 most populous countries. The presidential and legislative elections put to test human rights, economies, international relations, and prospects for peace in at least 64 countries. Among these, the spotlight is placed on five nations standing at critical crossroads: Taiwan, facing an existential threat from Beijing; the United States, navigating a divided nation; Russia, under the unrelenting grip of Putin; and India and Pakistan, enduring democratic hurdles amid regional pressures. The U.S. presidential election A rematch between President Joe Biden and Former President Donald Trump is imminent. While the matchup is a repeat of the 2020 presidential election, Trump’s court cases complicate his candidacy. Although the U.S. Constitution allows Trump to run even if he is convicted, his conviction might affect his election campaigns. Biden’s stance on the Israel-Hamas

The last year and a half seems like a blur. I couldn’t keep up with life. My homesickness reached its peak and the pressures of graduate school crushed me — I was struggling to find a way to fit into this world. My struggles with fitting into my community started in childhood. As an Indian girl, I grew up surrounded by outstandingly successful role models. These were people that have all achieved the unconventional, and I was taught that I should follow their path, so I knew a lot was expected from me by others. The culture I grew up in sometimes made me feel as though I could only satisfy those around me, especially my family, if I met their standards and fulfilled their expectations. Even when I became an adult, I carried the traces of this treatment. Hundreds of questions would hammer my brain constantly. Am I good

"Revolution in Our Lifetime" Exhibition highlights the history of The Black Panther Party in Baltimore - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

The exhibition "Revolution in Our Lifetime": The Black Panther Party and Political Organizing in Baltimore, 1968–1973, was unveiled at The Peale, Baltimore’s Community Museum, on Friday, April 12. The exhibit will be available until May 26. Curated by Hopkins and Morgan State University students, the exhibit features many primary sources, including never-before-seen material that provides insights into the Black Panther Party's Baltimore Chapter and political organizing during the period. In an email to The News-Letter, Professor Victoria Harms, one of two Hopkins faculty members involved with the project along with Professor Stuart Schrader, shared the success of the opening panel. "Over 100 people attended the roundtable conversation, and a record-setting total of almost 200 saw the exhibition on the first night! We were deeply impressed by the tremendous interest in our research findings and the history of the Black Panthers in the city," she wrote. As a collaborative effort, the

As the semester begins to slow down, scientific discovery has not. This week’s science news in review explores new findings from the James Webb Space Telescope, the discovery of a nitrogen-fixing organelle, an accident in molecular evolution and the legacy of Peter Higgs. Gamma-ray burst mystery: Supernova challenges expectations In October 2022, the most powerful energetic gamma-ray burst ever recorded struck Earth. The flash, referred to as the “brightest of all time” (BOAT), radiated gamma rays ten times more powerful than anything we have seen before. Existing knowledge predicted that the origin of the BOAT was a supernova called a collapsar. It is believed that collapsars can create the extreme conditions needed to produce heavy metals through nuclear fusion. However, a recent study observed nothing. No heavy elements were observed in the aftermath of BOAT. Other studies have confirmed these findings with astronomers failing to produce evidence of heavy element

Although the semester is wrapping up at Hopkins, science endeavors around the world continue to yield exciting discoveries. This week’s Science News in Review covers new technology to identify the origin of metastatic cancers, the long-term effects of pregnancy complications, novel neural circuitry for food motivation and appreciation for a butterfly in the Amazon. AI can detect the origin of metastatic cancers Metastasis occurs when cancer cells originating from one site in the body spread to other locations. Up to 5% of metastatic tumors’ origins cannot be identified. One traditional approach to identifying the origin of metastatic cancer relies on imaging fluid samples that contain cancerous cells. By identifying the characteristic morphology of specific cancer cells in fluid samples, pathologists can infer where the tumor cells originated. However, this technique still fails to pinpoint the cancer origin in some patients. Motivated by these cases, researchers from China developed a deep-learning

Science supports the existence of free will - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Six months ago, Stanford University Professor Robert M. Sapolsky wrote a book titled Determined: A Science of Life Without Free Will, which argues that humans do not have free will. He calls for people to “stop attributing stuff to us that isn’t here.” He also critiques any system in which we punish or reward people because people have no control over their actions. Sapolsky’s thesis is that free will is a myth and, the sooner we accept that, the more just society will be. However, in reality, the science does not debunk but instead supports the existence of free will. For most of human civilization, philosophers have posited the existence of free will. This sentiment has driven many groups to incorporate free will as a central tenet of their ideology. For example, Christians’ belief in free will has helped them reconcile God’s all-powerful, all-good existence with the presence of worldly

The 112th Student Government Association (SGA) met for its first meeting on April 23. Executive President Stone Meng and President of the Senate Nasreen Naqvi discussed the general body meeting structure and potential modifications within the Senate. The presentation for members focused on expectations regarding attendance and general expectations on etiquette. Concerns over the new attendance policies were extensively discussed. Naqvi said that the amendment will be a work in progress over the summer. Vice President Amy Li presented the details of her meeting with Sheridan Dean of University Libraries Elisabeth Long about the opening of new study spaces at the Johns Hopkins Club in light of the upcoming renovation of the Milton S. Eisenhower Library (MSE). Discussion points brought up by the Senate included the renaming of the MSE, sectioned rooms to better fit its purpose as a library and a way to honor affiliates.

On Wednesday, March 27, Sheridan Dean of University Libraries, Archives, and Museums Elisabeth M. Long hosted a virtual town hall discussion on the current status of the Milton S. Eisenhower Library (MSE) renovation project, providing notable updates on the planning process. In an interview with The News-Letter, Lauren Knudson, a freshman majoring in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, discussed her perspective on the current state of the library. “I use the library a lot, probably 20 hours a week. I think there should be more speaking levels since the current spaces often get pretty crowded,” she said. “It would also be nice if there were more natural lighting rather than feeling like you are in a dungeon.” This year marks the 60th anniversary of the library's opening in 1964. Other than a minor renovation in the 1990s, the building has stayed much the same. The motivations behind the renovation include issues

The Milton S. Eisenhower Library (MSE), a staple of the Homewood Campus, has a rich and complex history. During the 1940s, the University faced a lack of space as Gilman Hall and other buildings on campus could not accommodate the growing number of texts in their archives. In 1947, former librarian Homer Halvorson noted that Hopkins would need to begin planning a new facility. However, construction took several decades to begin. It wasn’t until 1958 that the University began a 10-year, $76 million funding drive, according to the Baltimore News-Post. Specifically, a new library was listed as one of the primary needs for the campus. Later that year, it was decided that the new library would be built at the front of Keyser Quad, and preliminary construction began in June 1962. The architecture of the library followed the Georgian motifs of nearby buildings, with red brick and white trim. Former

Milton S. Eisenhower (MSE) Library is slated for a complete renovation beginning in summer 2024. As the University’s principal research library since 1964, MSE has only had minor updates over the years. The MSE Modernization Project, which will encompass the approximately 182,000-square-foot library, will have an estimated cost of $100 million and is expected to take two and a half years. Its renovation will impact more than 26,000 students and 7,500 faculty across nine divisions. The project will also generate jobs for the Baltimore community. In particular, the HopkinsLocal program commits to contract to the project at least 20% minority or women-owned business enterprises and 13% local business enterprises. According to the FAQ section of the project’s website, there are plans for the general public outside of the Hopkins community to have access to the revamped library in an effort to increase interaction between the University and the local community.

We, Johns Hopkins student organizations advocating for reproductive justice, condemn the University’s choice of Mitt Romney as the 2024 commencement speaker. In particular, we are calling attention to Senator Romney’s damaging views on reproductive health which disproportionately affect marginalized communities. Romney voiced support for the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that overturned the constitutional right to abortion. He has maintained this anti-abortion position since 2011, when he declared that “[he] support[s] the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine.” Abortion is healthcare. In the years since Roe was overturned, we’ve seen devastating effects. In a national survey of obstetricians and gynecologists, nearly seven out of ten providers have reported that the ruling limited their ability to manage pregnancy-related emergencies. The Dobbs decision deepened health inequities, exacerbating existing racial maternal mortality crises: Black and brown people who give birth are

On Wednesday, March 27, the University announced that Mitt Romney, a U.S. Senator from Utah, will give the commencement speech for the Class of 2024 on May 23. Romney was sworn in as a senator for Utah in 2019. Previously, he served as the governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007. Romney has run for the Republican presidential nomination twice and was selected as the presidential nominee in 2012. According to the Hub, Romney will receive an honorary doctor of humane letters degree in the commencement ceremony. In the article, University President Ronald J. Daniels explained that Hopkins chose Romney as the speaker because of his commitment to improving the lives of Americans and maintaining moderate political ideologies. "At a time when our politics are at serious risk of being undermined by extreme polarization, Senator Romney reminds us that the spirit of compromise and civic friendship—even among political rivals—remains a

How many different textures can you see in a night? How many patterns and shapes? How did the designer think of this? Was this show everything they imagined? Is this something you could ever even imagine without seeing it first? These were the thoughts running through my head as I sat, dazzled, in the audience of the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA)’s 30th Annual Benefit Fashion Show. This year’s theme was “Upturn” and was meant to call “upon the artist, and therefore the audience, to question their relationship with society — and ultimately, with themselves.” This is not easy, nor is it comfortable. While certainly provocative, the designs I saw did not exclude comfort or ease. In fact, the show began on a particularly wholesome note. The opening collection was called “Hyphae-nate,” and was created by designers Austin Chia and Anaitza Brown as a dedication to the creativity of

Every college student chases after this arbitrary thing called freedom. To some, it means to study whatever they want. To others, it means to say “screw it” and go to Coachella in the middle of the semester. But for me, it looks more like what Chris McCandless did in Into the Wild — to buy a beat-up car after college, sell everything else he owns and vanish into a long road trip into the wilderness. Well (SPOILER ALERT), maybe minus the dying in Alaska part. I haven’t graduated yet and don’t have enough money for a car, nor do I have the courage like McCandless did. I did, however, have a badminton tournament in Boston and needed to drive the team up to the venue. 300 miles on I-95 along industrial New Jersey doesn’t quite compare to a tour of the American Wild West but, at this time of my

As the school year draws to a close, The News-Letter is reflecting on the successes and challenges of this year and our role in the Hopkins community. It is a unique time to be working for a college newspaper. Following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, college campuses are making national headlines as student protests and institutional practices come under scrutiny. As editors of The News-Letter, watching breaking news notifications about our peer institutions roll in makes us wonder: What is the role of a university newspaper? Are we even making an impact? What can we do better? The News-Letter has a rich and storied history of reporting on issues important to the Hopkins community. From documenting the Vietnam war protests in the 1970s to tracking the development of the Johns Hopkins Police Department, we have served as an archival source for the news and events on campus since 1896.

After a year and a half of logging onto Zoom meetings, most of us had our first in-person class last week. With students lounging on the Beach, studying at Brody and indulging in the grilled cheese at the FFC, it’s clear: we have achieved some sense of pre-Pandemic normalcy. Is this a good thing? Before the pandemic, most Hopkins students concentrated almost exclusively on excelling in their academics and maintaining a rigorous course load, often at the expense of their own mental health. The University itself released data in 2018 in which the majority of students described feeling overwhelmed and depressed at school. Hopkins is notorious for being a challenging school with demanding courses and overachieving students, but is this reputation sustainable? Do we really want to come back to the campus culture we left in 2020? Being sent home forced us all to take time for ourselves and reevaluate

Nine months after its draft recommendations were released, the Task Force on Student Mental Health and Well-being published its final report on Thursday detailing specific ways that the University can improve mental health on campus. The Task Force was composed of students, faculty and staff from all nine divisions. The report recommends that the University promote a climate of support, increase student access to mental health services and provide mental health awareness training to students, faculty and staff. In addition to its recommendations, the report includes information about University mental health services as well as data from the 2016 Enrolled Student Survey. Out of the 16,014 students who received a survey, 14.1 percent responded. The data compares mental health at Hopkins with that of peer institutions. Fifty-eight percent of students reported feeling overwhelmed “often or very often.” A majority of students indicated that at least occasionally, they were so overwhelmed

Writing about work culture at Hopkins is tricky. We acknowledge that we are extremely privileged to be able to attend college, surrounded by scholars who are the very best in their field and peers who are already accomplishing so much. We are grateful to pursue our higher education in Baltimore, at one of the nation’s top institutions. And yet, as finals approach, and Brody remains full, many of us are burnt out. Burnout is such a core part of our experience that we often forget to ask how it starts and why it persists. Especially at this time of the year, there’s a dissonance between the joy we’re supposed to find on sunnier days — during Alumni Weekend and Spring Fair and afternoons lying on the Beach — with the constant feeling of being on-edge and tired. We’re exhausted – mentally and physically. And it seems like there is no

In an email to Hopkins affiliates Wednesday morning, University leaders announced a two-day suspension of in-person classes and activities on the Homewood Campus after a spike in COVID-19 cases on Monday. The preliminary investigation revealed that the cluster was tied to an off-campus social gathering over the weekend. “We are taking a quick and proactive approach to this moment, although our numbers are small relative to our total population, out of an abundance of caution and to provide the opportunity to reinforce our communications with undergraduates about COVID safety precautions,” the administrators wrote. “Those who tested positive and live in our residence halls have been transferred to isolation housing, and others are isolating in place off campus.” There were 38 new positive student cases from 1,133 tests on Tuesday, which was the first testing day after the weekend since testing operations were suspended on Monday due to inclement weather.

Following a four-month investigation by the Office of the Dean of Student Life, the University has issued a two-year suspension to the Alpha Delta Phi (WAWA) fraternity. Though the fraternity could have applied for automatic re-recognition after the suspension lifted, Alpha Delta Phi chose instead to revoke their recognition at the University and with their national office. Vice Provost for Student Affairs Kevin Shollenberger announced the suspension in a campus-wide email on Thursday. “Alpha Delta Phi is no longer a recognized student organization, even if operating under a different name,” he wrote. “All members of our student community should be aware that any activities of an organization, ‘underground’ or otherwise, that violate university policies and/or the Student Conduct Code could result in misconduct charges against individual students.” The Office of the Dean of Student Life had been investigating the fraternity for allegations of assault, hazing and violations of its cease

Earlier this week, a wheel dozer and a metal wire mesh fence along with several portable toilets appeared on the Freshman Quad, the patch of grass in front of the Alumni Memorial Residence dorm buildings. Here the University is building a temporary 9,000-square-foot structure — essentially, a large party tent used for outdoor weddings — to prepare for the hybrid reopening in the spring semester. In an email to The News-Letter, Assistant Vice President of External Relations for the Office of Communications Karen Lancaster shared that the structure will help facilitate socially distanced gatherings. “It will serve students with access to power and Wi-Fi and be configured to support eating and/or studying within social distancing guidelines,” she wrote. “[Heating, ventilation and air conditioning] systems supplemented by operable windows will assure an abundance of fresh air throughout.” Construction is expected to be completed by mid-January and is carried out by Whiting-Turner,

The United States is entering a new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, with cases surging across the country. The seven-day moving average of new cases is at its third peak since the beginning of the pandemic. More than 83,000 new cases were added Friday and Saturday, marking the two highest numbers of new cases added in a single day. Experts warn that daily cases could soon be at six digits with fall holidays approaching and the weather getting colder, forcing people to be indoors. COVID-19 cases are also increasing in Maryland but have yet to hit the record seven-day moving average of 1,090 cases set in early May. Balancing safe socialization practices with academic work and mental health have presented challenges for students living off-campus in Baltimore. For Natalie Wu, a first-year student at the School of Advanced International Studies, staying safe from COVID-19 means adhering to guidelines from the

Editor’s Note: This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available. University President Ronald J. Daniels announced in an email to the Hopkins community that all undergraduate classes will be offered online for the entire fall semester. Ongoing on-campus research will resume in accordance to Phase 1 guidelines. Additionally, the University will also reduce tuition by 10 percent, and most incoming freshmen will not be able to live on campus. “Based on extensive consultations with our faculty experts in public health and medicine, and emerging guidance from public health officials, we have concluded that returning in person would pose unacceptable risks for you, our faculty and staff, and our neighbors in Baltimore,“ Daniels wrote. The decision was made out of a public health concern, as the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is getting worse in Baltimore and across the U.S. Additionally, 30 percent of undergraduate students would

Amid the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, University President Ronald J. Daniels announced in an email to the student body on March 10 that as of March 11, Hopkins is canceling in-person classes through at least April 12. Following spring break, the University will transition to remote instruction for all undergraduate courses. “At this time, we are aware that we have members of our community who are in the process of being tested for COVID-19, including several students who may have had exposure. With this in mind, as well as advice from public health experts regarding community transmission, limited availability of testing, and the need to shift from containment to mitigation strategies, we have decided to adopt the following immediate changes to our policies and academic programming,” Daniels wrote. In a later email, Dean of the Krieger School of Arts & Sciences (KSAS) Beverly Wendland clarified that all exams are suspended

Amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the University announced on Wednesday that it is assessing the placement of study abroad students worldwide. In an interview with The News-Letter, junior Siena DeMatteo, who was studying in Bologna, recalled learning that she would have to return to the U.S. “On Sunday the 23, my classes were canceled for the week and from there, little by little, the situation worsened,” she said. “It felt inevitable, but the fact that I had gotten confirmation just before going to sleep that Friday night that my program was still on and then waking up to that news Saturday morning was definitely a shock. But at the end of the day, I knew it was going to come to this.” According to the Hub, seven undergraduates studying abroad in Italy have returned or are returning soon to the U.S. The decision to suspend these programs came after Italy

University President Ronald J. Daniels and fellow administrators announced in an email to the Hopkins community that the University will be resuming in-person activities in the fall. These plans are not yet final, as the University is seeking additional input. The email stressed that plans for the upcoming semester are prone to change if the public health situation demands it. However, administrators hope to reach a finalized approach for returning to campus by mid-July. Rising sophomore Lubna Azmi, a first-generation/limited income (FLI) student, explained that she is hesitant about the plans in the email, which was sent on June 30. “The best decision would be to keep quarantining but no one in America is getting that,” she wrote in an email to The News-Letter. “Everyone is restless to get back to how things were... when at this point, we need new plans because people are going to die.” The statement

When University President Ronald J. Daniels announced that the semester would be entirely remote in his August 6 email, he noted that tuition would be reduced by 10 percent and that the Office of Financial Aid was allocating $15 million in additional assistance money. Heading into the fall semester, students who requested additional aid are ultimately pleased with their grants, but feel that they lacked support throughout the process. In an email to The News-Letter, Assistant Vice Provost for Financial Aid and Director of Student Financial Services Tom McDermott noted that the Office of Financial Aid is now expecting to give out $18 million in additional aid as a result of the pandemic. According to him, $4 million went towards eliminating the expectation of summer savings, a projection of $11 million for appeals and another $3 million for students who are unable to secure work-study jobs because of the pandemic.

Provost Sunil Kumar and Vice Provost for Student Affairs Alanna Shanahan announced in an email to the student body on Oct. 1 that the University will have a plan for the spring semester by Thanksgiving at the latest. They also noted that all intersession classes will be held virtually. “We have important and difficult decisions ahead of us as we look to the spring semester, and right now we can tell you how we are approaching them, if not where we will ultimately land,” they wrote. If Hopkins opens for the spring semester, all in-person activities will be optional for students and faculty, and no student will be required to physically be on campus. Most courses will continue to be offered remotely for students. The University is also considering changing the schedule for spring, such as starting the term later or cancelling spring break.

Vice Provost for Student Affairs Alanna Shanahan and Associate Vice Provost for Education Janet Schreck announced the formation of a student advisory committee in an email to the student body on May 12. The committee will be tasked with providing feedback on University plans and brainstorming ideas as to what the process of reopening campus might look like amid the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. University President Ronald J. Daniels suspended in-person classes on March 10. In an email to The News-Letter, sophomore Marissa McDonald stated that she will strive to prioritize the student experience as a member of the committee. “I came to Hopkins not simply for an education, but for the opportunities that are presented every day through applied learning and forming connections with people who are leaders in their fields,” she wrote. “I joined the committee so that my remaining two years at Hopkins will be as enriching

University President Ronald J. Daniels and other administrators announced in an email to University affiliates on Monday that Hopkins will offer in-person classes, research activities and housing in the spring semester. “Our plans are shaped by your tremendous efforts to date to carry out our education, research and clinical missions safely, as well as the guidance of public health experts at Johns Hopkins and nationally and the best practices of those peer institutions that have successfully returned to campus this fall,” they wrote. “They rest on continued strict adherence to public health guidelines, significant de-densification of our facilities and a widening of our testing program and requirements.” Daniels noted that the University will make a final determination on whether to carry out the plans in January based on various public health metrics. Starting in January, free weekly asymptomatic tests will be available to all affiliates. Undergraduate students living in both

By the time University announced its decision on August 6 to conduct the fall semester fully online, many students had already signed their leases and made plans to return to campus. While some scrambled to sublet their apartments and cancel their travel arrangements, others decided to return to Baltimore despite the University urging students to stay home. The decision to cancel all in-person activities for the fall semester came over a month after the University’s initial hybrid plan. As explained in an email on June 30, the University intended to have some classes in person, with others fully online. Traditional on-campus housing would be guaranteed for freshmen, while sophomores could choose to live in University-run hotels or secure their own housing. Juniors and seniors, who traditionally live off-campus, would continue to do so. The University explained that no student had to return to Baltimore in order to complete their academic

Vice Provost for Student Affairs Alanna Shanahan and Vice Provost for Student Health and Well-Being Kevin Shollenberger announced in an email on August 26 that they will be distributing Wellness Kits to students residing in Charles Village. The Wellness Kits will be available at the Barnes & Noble on St. Paul Street from August 31 to Sept. 4 from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Wellness Kits include wipes, a digital thermometer, hand sanitizer and two masks — one with an Under Armour logo, another with a Hopkins logo. Students picking up their Wellness Kits will be required to wear a face covering. They will also need to bring a mobile device to scan their QR code through the Campus Groups app before receiving their kits.

The University announced on Sept. 24 that all affiliates spending time on campus will be required to get a flu vaccination by Nov. 20. The policy applies to all students participating in on-campus activities, as well as University employees and non-employees working in University properties or leased facilities. Hopkins will be providing vaccinations free-of-charge to students in the United States, regardless of whether they are engaging in on-campus activities. Junior Izzy Geada, who is living off-campus in Baltimore, stated that she was glad the University was taking these precautions. “Frankly, it’s a relief. It’s pretty comforting that we don’t have to worry about the flu as well as corona,” she said. “At least one thing will be handled.” However, Geada also noted that the University still does not provide asymptomatic coronavirus (COVID-19) testing for students living off-campus, which she argued should be a priority.

University President Ronald J. Daniels and other administrators announced in an email to University affiliates today that Hopkins will open for increased in-person activities for Homewood undergraduates in the spring semester. Hopkins will enter Phase Two of reopening, as laid out in a draft plan released three weeks ago. All undergraduate students will be required to be tested for COVID-19 twice a week beginning Jan. 11 and to use the Prodensity app daily before coming to campus. Face coverings must be worn at all times, and students are instructed to avoid large gatherings. The Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and Whiting School of Engineering will offer 18% of their undergraduate courses in-person. Those classes will start online at the beginning of the semester but switch to in-person instruction on Feb. 2. Graduate schools and the Peabody Institute will communicate their respective plans for the spring, which may vary. No

The Prodensity app was designed through a collaboration between the Johns Hopkins Technology Innovation Center (TIC); Geraldine Seydoux, the vice dean for basic research at the School of Medicine; and George Economas, the executive director of security for Hopkins Medical Institutions. The app originally began as a way for labs to keep track of who was using their facilities and when. It has recently expanded to include daily health checks and communication tools. Development of the app began in mid-April, after all on-campus activities and research were limited to essential activities due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. During that time, many of the labs at the School of Medicine realized that they had no method to keep track of who should be let into facilities, creating a logistical nightmare for many researchers and principal investigators (PIs). When it became clear that the School of Medicine would allow for some increased

Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott announced new restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the city earlier today. Both indoor and outdoor dining will be prohibited. Outdoor gatherings in public and private facilities will be limited to 25 people, while all indoor gatherings will be capped at 10 people. Religious and retail facilities, gyms, museums and casinos will be open for 25% of maximum occupancy. The restrictions will go into effect at 5 p.m. on Friday, Dec. 11. Restaurants will be able to continue offering carry-out, delivery and drive-through service. In a press conference announcing the restrictions, Scott addressed the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Maryland reported 2,632 new cases on Tuesday, and 50 deaths were related to the virus, the highest daily number of deaths reported during the pandemic. “This is about saving lives — nothing more and nothing less,” Scott said. “COVID doesn’t get tired, COVID doesn’t take

On September 1, Governor Larry Hogan announced that Maryland will enter stage three of the state’s Roadmap to Recovery Plan beginning on Friday at 5 p.m. Local leaders, however, are left to determine whether to move forward with lifting restrictions. All businesses and manufacturing services in Maryland will be allowed to reopen. Religious facilities, retail businesses and malls can reopen at 75 percent capacity. Indoor recreation areas, restaurants and theaters can reopen but at a 50 percent capacity or a maximum of 100 people. Despite Hogan’s announcement, Baltimore City Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young announced a day later that the city will remain in the first stage of the state’s reopening plan. “While some parts of the state may feel ready to move into phase three, that is not the case for Baltimore City. The data for Baltimore looks promising and we anticipate moving to phase two next week,” Young

Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young announced on June 19 that Baltimore will enter stage two of reopening following shutdowns to prevent the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). This measure follows the state-wide safer-at-home advisory and city-wide decision to allow outdoor dining and limited reopening of non-essential retail stores. Under phase two, non-essential businesses, public spaces and faith-based entities will be allowed to reopen with precautionary measures in place. Restaurants will be able to offer indoor seating at up to 50 percent of maximum capacity. Indoor and outdoor pools, libraries, the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore, the National Aquarium and museums will be allowed to open with the same limited capacity requirements. Following decreased hospitalization rates and other key indices, Maryland entered into stage two of the “Maryland Strong: Roadmap to Recovery” plan on June 5, per Governor Larry Hogan’s orders. Local jurisdictions were allowed to tailor the reopening timeline. At that

Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced that he is lifting the state’s stay-at-home order, replacing it with a public health advisory called “safer at home.” As of May 15 at 5 p.m., Marylanders are encouraged to stay at home, particularly those who are at-risk for contracting the coronavirus (COVID-19). However, retail stores and places of worship will be allowed to open, provided that they only permit half of their maximum capacity to enter at once. Additionally, businesses such as hair salons and barber shops are permitted to open, provided that they are appointment-only and conform to social distancing practices. This lifting of restrictions comes after a two-week plateau of COVID-19 cases in Maryland. However, leaders in certain areas of Maryland with more cases, such as Baltimore City, have decided to maintain stay-at-home restrictions for the time being.

Maryland Governor Larry Hogan issued an order this morning directing all Maryland residents to stay in their residences beginning at 8 p.m. tonight. This order also closed all non-essential businesses — including senior centers, restaurants and bars, fitness centers, theaters and malls — to the public. Under the order, members of the public are allowed to leave their residences to conduct certain essential activities. These include purchasing necessary household supplies, seeking medical attention or advice, providing necessary care for another, receiving a meal or instructional material from an educational institution, engaging in outdoor exercise and engaging in public business. The order specifies that any violation of its directives constitutes a misdemeanor offense and carries a maximum penalty of a $5,000 fine and one year in prison. Governmental bodies, media outlets and non-profit organizations serving low-income Marylanders are specifically excluded from the requirement of the order that all non-essential businesses close.

Baltimore City Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young announced that restaurants can resume indoor dining at 25 percent capacity beginning on Friday, August 7. This follows Young’s previous orders from July 24 to suspend all indoor dining services after a recent spike in coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in Maryland. Other gatherings are also still restricted, including: religious facilities, retail establishments, casinos and indoor recreation establishments. These establishments will be capped at whichever is lower — 25 percent capacity or 25 people. Young’s latest executive order excludes bars, which must remain closed. Outdoor gatherings can only have a maximum of 25 participants. Young’s new guidelines are stricter than the rest of Maryland. Governor Larry Hogan issued statewide guidelines to cap indoor dining capacities at 50 percent. However, the governor granted smaller jurisdictions the liberty of imposing stricter regulations depending on public health needs.

Democrat Brandon Scott, president of the Baltimore City Council, was elected to be the city’s 52nd mayor on Nov. 3. Succeeding Bernard C. “Jack” Young, Scott, at age 36, will become Baltimore’s youngest-ever mayor. He will be officially sworn into office on Dec. 20. With a total of 118,621 votes, Scott garnered 51.3% more of the votes than his main opponent, Independent nominee Bob Wallace. Republican nominee Shannon Wright and Working Class Party nominee David Harding followed Wallace in number of votes received. After receiving a concession call from Wallace, Scott declared his victory and thanked his supporters. “Baltimore, our city has voted for a new way forward,” Scott said. “I stand before you tonight, a son of Baltimore and the next mayor of our great city. I am so proud, energized and humbled by your belief in me and what we can accomplish together.” Scott was the youngest candidate

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agents raided Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh’s house and offices at City Hall on Thursday. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan called on her to resign in a public statement hours later, following the lead of the City Council and the Greater Baltimore Committee (GBC), a regional organization comprised of University President Ronald J. Daniels and other business and civic leaders. Pugh’s business dealings have been under state investigation for more than a month. On April 1, Pugh’s office announced that she would be taking an indefinite leave of absence to recover from pneumonia. This statement coincided with a report from The Baltimore Sun detailing that health care company Kaiser Permanente had purchased about 200,000 copies of Pugh’s Healthy Holly children’s books for $114,000 between 2015 and 2018. During this period, Kaiser Permanente was negotiating with the city’s spending panel to provide city

Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh resigned on Thursday, May 2 in light of controversy over sales of her children’s book series, becoming the second Baltimore mayor this decade to step down amid a criminal investigation. She apologized for the damage she has done to the legitimacy of her office and the face of the city in a statement her attorney Steven Silverman delivered at a news conference. “Dear citizens of Baltimore, I would like to thank you for allowing me to serve as the 50th mayor. It has been an honor and privilege,” Pugh said in the statement. “I’m sorry for the harm that I have caused to the image of the city of Baltimore and the credibility of the office of the mayor. Baltimore deserves a mayor who can move our great city forward.” After a month-long state investigation into her business dealings, Pugh has resigned, effective immediately. On April

President Brandon Scott of the Baltimore City Council won the Democratic primary for Baltimore Mayor with 29.46 percent of the vote on June 9. The official race call comes a week after the Maryland primary elections. After the in-person votes were tallied, former Baltimore Mayor Sheila Dixon held a slight lead over Scott. However, Scott finished with a 2,358-vote lead over Dixon once the mail-in ballots were factored into the results. Dixon was followed in votes by Mary Miller, Thiru Vignarajah, Incumbent Mayor Bernard “Jack” Young and T.J. Smith. A former representative for Baltimore’s second district, Scott received endorsements from several local officials, state officials and organizations, including the Baltimore Sun and Sunrise Movement Baltimore. His platform centers around a holistic crime reduction strategy and government transparency and accountability. Scott is expected to defeat Republican nominee Shannon Wright in the mayoral election in November. He shared his hopes as mayor

The killing of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police Department has sparked nationwide protests to highlight police brutality and promote racial justice. These protests have occurred in over 350 cities. In addition, people have shown their solidarity with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement through donations, petitions and social media. Although media coverage of the protests has recently propelled police brutality into the American spotlight, rising senior Bentley Addison noted that black Americans have felt this issue for years. “I think about it whenever I’m driving and I take a wrong turn, or when I’m walking in Baltimore and end up in a richer area, or when my brother leaves the house. This fear of ‘the next time it happens, is it going to be me or someone I know?’ is something that every black person in America lives with,” Addison said. “I vividly remember my father

 Henrietta Lacks’ estate to sue Hopkins Hospital - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

In 1951, the Johns Hopkins Hospital took cervical cancer cells from Henrietta Lacks, a black Baltimore resident, and developed the HeLa cell line. Her cells contributed to major medical discoveries, including the development of polio vaccine. Neither Henrietta nor her family gave the Hospital permission to use her cells at the time. Some members of the Lacks family, who had formerly made peace with Hopkins after learning in the 1970s that it had taken Henrietta’s cells, now plan to sue the Hospital in the coming weeks. They also want compensation from other individuals and institutes, including the National Institute of Health (NIH); Rebecca Skloot, the author of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks; Crown Publishing; and HBO, which plans to release a movie starring Oprah Winfrey based on Skloot’s book. Hopkins Hospital claims it does not profit from Henrietta Lacks’ cells, stating that it never patented the HeLa cells and

On Thursday, April 18, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan approved legislation that will allow Hopkins to establish a private police force. By signing the bill – titled the Community Safety and Strengthening Act – into law, Hogan has authorized Hopkins to be the first private university in Maryland to have its own police force. University President Ronald J. Daniels released a statement where he praised the bill’s passage and explained the next steps for the planned police force. “The law will go into effect on July 1, 2019, after which we will enter a multiyear process of implementation. There will be many steps to come as we collaborate with the city of Baltimore, our neighbors, and the university community around the operational and public accountability structures for establishing the police department,” Daniels wrote. Administrators will now begin negotiating a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Baltimore Police Department (BPD), as well

Daniel Ennis, the University’s senior vice president for finance and administration, and Robert Kasdin, Hopkins Medicine’s senior vice president, chief financial officer and chief operating officer, announced on Thursday the opening of the application period for the University’s Police Accountability Board in an email to the community. The Accountability Board will be comprised of five community members unaffiliated with the University and 10 Hopkins students, faculty members and staff. In an interview with The News-Letter, Jarron Jackson, Campus Safety and Security senior director, explained that these ratios were set by the Community Strengthening Act — which established the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) — and supported through best-practices research. Jackson further explained the intent behind the establishment of the Accountability Board. He stated that the board will serve as a way for community members to share their opinions about the JHPD and its establishment directly with the University. “This is

Over 100 University faculty members have signed an open letter in opposition to Senate Bill (SB) 793 and House Bill (HB) 1094, which would allow Hopkins to create its own private police force. As of Feb. 20, 104 faculty had signed the letter. The open letter lists several concerns regarding the creation of a privately-owned University police force, including that this police force would undermine the relationship between Hopkins and the Baltimore community. “We believe that armed personnel introduce dangerous firearms and can decrease public safety, endanger our own students, and increase risk. We are concerned that once in place, police administrations will inevitably amplify the climate of fear and justify their roles by citing stops, arrests, and detainments,” the letter reads. “We wish to see the university taking on the role of constructive partner in a complex public issue of public health and educational equity and community well-being.” Susan

UNITE HERE Local 7, a chapter of the international labor union that represents Hopkins employees in food service, staged a rally on Homewood Campus on Friday afternoon in response to the University’s decision to suspend payment to its furloughed workers. According to a UNITE HERE Local 7 announcement, the University has reneged on a private commitment it made in late March with union representatives to provide four weeks of uninterrupted pay for furloughed and laid-off contract workers. This announcement comes as one of many University attempts to cut costs. Two weeks ago, the University announced it planned to suspend contributions to most faculty and staff retirement plans, restrict faculty and staff hiring and freeze base salary increases for faculty and staff as part of austerity measures intended to cut the University’s losses in FY21. At the rally, over one dozen workers standing approximately six feet apart held up signs that

Phase One involves reopening low-risk activities, while student group meetings, large programs and any trainings will remain online. Phase Two-A will open spaces for student engagement with attendance caps. Phase Two-B will allow recreation and wellness classes, certain intramurals, community service and tabling to resume.

Vice Provost for Student Affairs Alanna Shanahan announced plans to renovate the Recreation (Rec) Center, which will expand existing workout spaces and add a cafe, in a University-wide email on Tuesday. The $27 million project will be funded by a gift from the Rec Center’s namesake Ralph S. O’Connor, who died in December 2018. When the renovation is completed in August 2021, the facility will gain an extra 15,000 square feet — doubling the size of strength and cardio areas. Students who work at the Rec Center pointed out that workout areas have suffered from overcrowding, while fitness classes have been capped due to lack of space. Senior Kayla Klatt, who has worked at the Rec Center since 2017, wrote in an email to The News-Letter that the project was carefully planned, based on information collected over the past few years. “The Rec Center staff has been monitoring which areas

Spring Fair has been an annual tradition at Hopkins for nearly half a century. Billed as the nation’s largest student-run festival, the event brings local musicians, carnival rides and community members to Homewood Campus. This fall, an organizational review in light of allegations of hazing, underage drinking and other violations of the Student Conduct Code prevented Spring Fair Committee (Spring Fair) from planning for the celebration, generally a yearlong endeavor. By now, the artist performing at the headliner concert the Saturday of Spring Fair has usually been selected. JHUnions and Programming Director Hal Turner, who oversees Spring Fair, told The News-Letter on Tuesday that the concert, typically held at Rams Head Live! downtown, will take place in the Recreation Center on April 18. The relocation, he believes, will make the concert more accessible and manageable. As contracts have not yet been finalized, Turner declined to predict when the artist will

This fall, the Office of Student Leadership and Involvement (SLI) informed dozens of student groups that they had deficits in their accounts going back several years, sometimes upward of a decade. Some groups learned that they owed tens of thousands of dollars to the University, according to Student Government Association (SGA) Executive President AJ Tsang. SLI told two groups that they had accumulated over $100,000 in debt. “It’s unsettling that this much debt and these many deficits could have existed for as long as they have without being noticed,” Tsang said. “It’s worrying that current students are paying for mistakes that were made in the past, either by their distant predecessors or by SLI itself.” Tsang explained that while working with SLI, Dean of Student Life Smita Ruzicka, who joined the University this August, uncovered unpaid security charges for events, along with other previously unknown deficits.

Homewood Campus held its annual Spring Fair this weekend. The event was open to the entire Baltimore community. It kicked off the evening of Thursday, April 25 with fireworks and included a concert headlined by electronic dance music group Cash Cash, other musical performances, vendors, dances, games and a beer garden. Although the Spring Fair committee underwent serious budget cuts and had several disagreements with the administration, Co-Chairs Sofya Freyman and Meera McLane told The News-Letter in a joint email that they were pleased with how the weekend turned out. “Considering the major changes that had been enforced on Spring Fair this year, we think it went great,” they wrote. “All of our committees either had no budget to work with or [their budget] was cut significantly, and all of their events were a success.” Earlier this year Spring Fair discovered that they were significantly in debt from previous spending.

The 47th annual Spring Fair brought food, vendors and local musicians to Homewood Campus this past weekend. Like previous years, this year’s Spring Fair included food and craft vendors as well as carnival-style rides. Some questioned the choice of Earl Sweatshirt as one of the two headlining musicians at this year’s concert. Many people enjoyed the festivities, including senior Jose Solis. He said he enjoyed his time at Spring Fair, emphasizing the variety of activities. “All the seniors just get to hang out and have a good time, and the food is always a pleasure,” he said. Class of 2017 alumnus Aisa Moreno also enjoyed the fair. “It’s also just nice to see a lot of alumni come back,” she said. Spring Fair also attracts many members of the wider Baltimore community.

Hal Turner was appointed as the University’s inaugural director of JHUnions & Programming this August. In this role, Turner oversees student groups such as the Hopkins Organization for Programming (HOP), the JHUnions Programming Board, Hoptoberfest, the Johns Hopkins University Model United Nations Conference (JHUMUNC) and Spring Fair. He also supervises student managers and monitors in the Mattin Center, the LaB and areas of Levering Hall. JHUnions separated from the Office of Student Leadership and Involvement (SLI) in February. This division was intended to allow SLI to continue to focus on supporting student organization processes, whereas JHUnions would be able to concentrate on large-scale programming.

University President Ronald J. Daniels announced on Tuesday evening that the school will be building a student center where the Mattin Center is currently located. At the end of the Shriver Hall reopening ceremony Daniels invited attendees to a celebration at the Beach that included food trucks, live music and seesaws. At the celebration, Daniels announced the student center project. In a schoolwide email, Daniels explained the vision for the new building. “This will be a new kind of space for us — one that is not academically focused, but entirely social by design,” he wrote. “It will be a site to which everyone lays equal claim and from which everyone benefits.” Junior Emily Velandia, who attended the celebration at the Beach, agreed that a student center would positively impact the culture at Hopkins.

The student group Advocates for Disability Awareness (ADA) released a list of demands calling for better accommodations and resources for students with disabilities on Monday. The demands follow the firing of Brent Mosser, the former director of Student Disability Services (SDS). Among their demands, ADA calls for the University to reinstate Mosser.

For decades, Hopkins students have yearned for a student center: a central space for the collective pursuit of our social and mental wellbeing. Hopkins is an outlier. A student center exists at nearly every other college and university campus in the United States (including the 33 peer institutions to which Hopkins compares itself), but not here. More schools have a student center than an armed private police force. What are the benefits of a student center, and how could it revolutionize the Hopkins culture? Most importantly, a student center would allow Hopkins to centralize student services. We recognize that Hopkins provides many student services already and there are many dedicated staff who administer them. However, the core issue today is a lack of accessibility. Student services are spread so widely across campus that walking between the two farthest points where the University will offer student programming (R House and the

Last spring, University President Ronald J. Daniels announced plans to construct a student center in the Mattin Center’s current location. Although many students were hopeful that such a building would encourage students to prioritize non-academic aspects of their lives, others expressed concerns regarding the loss of Mattin, which serves as a home for the visual and performing arts on campus and hosts the Swirnow Theater. To help with planning, the administration formed the Student Center Advisory Committee (SCAC), which is currently made up of 25 University faculty members, staff and students. The committee is chaired by Vice Provost for Student Affairs Alanna Shanahan. Shanahan wrote in an email to The News-Letter that everything currently in Mattin will begin to be moved out at the end of the 2021 spring semester. The demolition will begin after move-outs have been completed, she added, and construction is expected to start in the spring

This summer, the University made leadership changes intended to improve student well-being. Alanna Shanahan became vice provost for student affairs on August 12, succeeding Kevin Shollenberger, now the University’s first vice provost for student health and well-being. Formerly senior associate director of athletics, Jennifer Baker was promoted to Shanahan’s previous role as director of athletics and recreation.

Senior Art History and Archaeology major Casey lives with hearing loss and tinnitus caused by a traumatic event earlier in her life. During her sophomore year, she decided to book an appointment with the University’s Counseling Center to seek help in coping with her disability. Casey spent her initial appointment at the Center explaining the event which led to her hearing loss and tinnitus, a process she characterized as emotionally taxing. However, she said her follow-up counseling meeting was “disappointing in ways I really can’t even begin to describe.” Her therapist made recommendations which went against the advice of Casey’s other doctors and demonstrated a lack of basic understanding of the details from her initial appointment. “She recommended me to my own audiologist, for the program that I had described in detail the meeting before,” Casey said.

Eight students chained themselves to the stairwells in Garland Hall around 4 p.m. on Wednesday, May 1. Students and community members began the sit-in at Garland Hall on April 3 to protest the proposed private police force and the University’s contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). As of press time, the sit-in reached its 30th day. The protesters hope to finally meet with University President Ronald J. Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar to discuss their demands. They believe that the extreme act of chaining themselves to the building will force the administration to begin negotiations. Hopkins Coalition Against ICE (HCAI) member Adela Chelminski has been involved the sit-in since the first day. She explained to The News-Letter that the protesters felt ignored by the administration and that continual demands for negotiations were rebuffed. “We are staying here through finals, and we are staying here through the summer if need

Editor’s Note: This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available. Vice Provost for Student Affairs Kevin Shollenberger and Vice President for Human Resources Heidi Conway sent a University-wide email addressing the eight student protesters who chained themselves to stairwells in Garland Hall at around 4 p.m. on Thursday, May 2. Student and community members began the Garland sit-in on April 3 to protest the planned private police force, the bill for which Maryland Governor Larry Hogan signed into law on April 18, and the University’s contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “Yesterday afternoon, the protesters dramatically escalated this situation by blocking ingress to and egress from the building, harassing staff and security officers, chaining the doors of the building closed, and covering security cameras. This escalation interrupted exams for students with disabilities, prevented student workers from being paid, and significantly disrupted financial aid

 Are SGA and SLI supporting student groups?  - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By RUDY MALCOM                                                     | October 10, 2019
Three weeks ago, the Student Government Association (SGA) informed students that it would not be accepting new student organization applications this semester. The announcement also mentioned that SGA’s Committee on Student Organizations (CSO) would be working with the Office of Student Leadership and Involvement (SLI) to examine student groups’ practices, missions, funding and other criteria. SLI Director Calvin Smith, Jr., explained that SLI had already begun conducting audits on student groups, irrespective of CSO’s decision to enact the moratorium. The News-Letter spoke with students from SGA, Barnstormers, College Democrats, Spring Fair, Adoremus, Vocal Chords, Milton S. Eisenhower (MSE) Symposium and unrecognized groups about the impact of the audits and moratorium. Further, Smith shared his office’s plans to better support student groups.

The University’s Office of Student Leadership and Involvement (SLI) announced that they will not accept new performing arts and local community service groups this year. According to SLI Director Kirsten Fricke, the Center for Social Concern (CSC) and the Homewood Arts Program (HAP) implemented the restrictions. Administrators decided to stop accepting new performing arts groups because they argue that there is not enough space on campus for groups to hold practices and performances. Regarding service groups, CSC Associate Director Gia Grier explained that ideas for new groups often focused on issues already covered by existing organizations. She discussed some prevailing trends in community service at Hopkins. “There are popular topics, [including] health.

The Office of Student Leadership and Involvement (SLI) announced at the beginning of last semester that, due to limitations enacted by the Center for Social Concern (CSC) and the Homewood Arts Program (HAP), they would prohibit students from forming new performing arts and local community service groups for this academic year. According to HAP Director Eric Beatty, it is plausible that the ban on new performing arts groups will carry into the 2018-19 academic year because of insufficient time and space for rehearsals and performances. He cited the delayed renovations of Shriver Hall, which serves as a performance venue, as an added difficulty. JHU Sirens President Isabella Zellerbach shared the difficulties her a cappella group faces in finding performance and practice space. “There are only a few locations on campus that are large enough... for end-of-year a cappella concerts,” she wrote in an email to The News-Letter. “We usually begin

The University’s Office of Student Leadership and Involvement (SLI) announced at the beginning of the fall 2017 semester that it would not be accepting new performing arts and local community service groups during that academic year. While new local community service groups are now permitted to form, the restrictions on new performing arts groups remain in place. Homewood Arts Program (HAP) Director Eric Beatty wrote in an email to The News-Letter that HAP decided to maintain the restrictions on new performing arts groups because the challenges which prompted the restrictions last year still persist. The University will reconsider accepting new arts groups before the upcoming school year. “For this 18/19 year we are keeping the same policy as last year that there will not be the opportunity for students to apply to create a new performing arts group,” Beatty wrote. “This policy will be revisited again before the 19/20 academic

After undergoing three semesters of renovations, Shriver Hall has been reopened to the Hopkins community. The renovation, which began during the fall of 2017, was slated to be completed by the beginning of spring 2018. University officials announced in February 2018, however, that the project would extend into the 2018-2019 academic year. Though Johns Hopkins Facilities and Real Estate (JHFRE) originally planned on only replacing the auditorium’s lighting and electrical systems, the project expanded to include new features to the auditorium. The renovation was also delayed so that JHFRE could take measures to eliminate the possibility of asbestos buildup within the building. Homewood Arts Programs (HAP) Director Eric Beatty described some of the new features that Shriver auditorium contains in an email to The News-Letter. “The renovations in Shriver Hall auditorium will have many positive benefits for the Hopkins Symphony Orchestra and the Homewood Arts Programs dance and a cappella

 Performing arts groups report budgetary cuts - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Many performing arts groups on campus are reporting significant budget cuts this year from the Student Activities Commission (SAC), which is the funding board of the Student Government Association (SGA). According to Hamilton Sawczuk, the business manager for theater group the Barnstormers, the group received a budget cut of almost 50 percent this year. Sawczuk stated that the Barnstormers will not be affected by the cuts this year, though the group is pursuing alternative sources of funding, such as external grants. However, he added that if the annual budget remains at this level in the future, the group would be limited in its ability to put on programming. “If this is the budget going forward for five years, then it’s going to have a big impact, at least, on where we get our money from, and if we’re able to put on the same level of productions as before,” he

The Office of Student Leadership and Involvement (SLI) and the Student Government Association (SGA) hosted a student organization summit in Shaffer Hall on Wednesday. Representatives from Shepley Bulfinch, the architectural firm that will help determine what goes in the student center, presented on the student input that they have collected at 16 engagement sessions. Afterward, senior Chase McAdams, chair of SGA’s Committee on Student Organizations (CSO), presented guidelines for student organization budgets, operating guidelines and the auditing process, which he said began on Monday. Junior Keelin Reilly, president of Students for Environmental Action (SEA) and member of comedy group the Buttered Niblets, acknowledged the necessity of the audits but argued that certain changes seemed excessive. “Our organization is not traditionally organized in the way they want it to be.

Incoming Student Government Association (SGA) Executive Treasurer Addy Perlman announced in an email to student leaders that student groups should expect cuts in their annual Student Activities Commission (SAC) fundings. The announcement was made in light of the University-wide austerity measures and was further discussed at the final weekly SGA meeting. Perlman noted in her Tuesday email that the budget allocation would be prioritized towards events that would have the most impact on the Hopkins community. She asked the group leaders to consider the possibility of collaborating with other student groups to pool their resources and create bigger events together. In an email to The News-Letter Perlman noted that the SGA is expecting the overall cuts to be around 10 to 15 percent. She added that this figure is subject to change based on further progression of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. SGA President-elect Sam Mollin expressed his regret regarding the

The University has committed itself to “a series of broad-based and decisive austerity measures” in response to newly-projected large budgetary shortfalls in both the present fiscal year (FY) as well as FY21. University President Ronald J. Daniels announced these measures in an email to the Hopkins community on Tuesday night. The University’s prior budgetary projections had put Hopkins on track to achieve a $72 million budgetary surplus by the close of FY20. Before any attempts at mitigation are considered, Hopkins is now projected to stand at a nearly $100 million deficit, according to the Financial Implications and Planning (FIP) report. For FY21, the projection before any mitigation was considered was similarly revised from an $80 million surplus to a $375 million deficit. According to University of California, Santa Barbara Professor of Economics Dick Startz, these projected deficits are serious, especially in light of the University’s total budget. “You don’t have

The Student Government Association (SGA) discussed changes to funding for student groups at its last weekly meeting of the semester on April 28. Executive Treasurer Eric Armstrong announced that due to University-wide austerity measures, SGA’s operating budget will likely decrease for the next school year. SGA uses this budget to co-host events with student groups, such as Sex Week or Pi Phi Field Day. Annual funding for student groups from SGA’s Student Activities Commission (SAC) is also expected to decrease. Armstrong, however, noted that he requested greater funding for SAC’s monthly grants. SAC provides both annual funding and monthly grants to student groups. Increased funding for SAC’s monthly grants would be used to offset the budget cuts that student groups could face in the coming school year. Despite these economic strains, Senior Class Senator Chase McAdams noted that SGA is still approving student groups. Several new groups were approved this

The Sexual Assault Resource Unit (SARU) and the Student Government Association (SGA) held their Sex Week event series this week as part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month. SARU, a student group that seeks to dismantle rape culture and support survivors of sexual violence, aimed for these events to educate students on how to have safe, consensual sex. The event series ran from April 13 to April 17 over the web conference platform Zoom. Senior Class Senator Chanel Lee and Junior Class Senator Addy Perlman had previously introduced a bill to fund the events for the week. Alongside webinars and workshops about mindfulness and self-care, the programming included events such as Examining Consent in Media, Sex Toy Bingo, Sex 101 with a Dominatrix, Ask-An-Ace and a Self-Love Sex Chat. Senior Deeya Bhattacharya, co-director of SARU, explained the purpose of having a breadth of different topics in the event series. “Sex Week,

Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM), observed in April, is an annual campaign to educate the public on how to prevent sexual violence. For the Sexual Assault Resource Unit (SARU), a student group that seeks to dismantle rape culture and support survivors of sexual violence, SAAM is an important opportunity to educate the student body. SARU has expanded its social media presence this month, spreading messages about consent — stating that it is enthusiastic, specific and can be taken away and communicated through body language. SARU Co-Director Reah Vasilakopoulos, a senior, explained that the organization has had to think creatively about transitioning to an online platform. Following the cancellation of in-person classes through the end of the spring semester due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, SARU and other student groups have been forced to adapt their practices. Junior Padmini Balaji, SARU’s events co-chair, highlighted the group’s efforts in an interview

Sophomore Madelynn Wellons, a survivor of sexual assault on Homewood campus, spoke out against Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos at a press conference on Jan. 25. Wellons shared her story outside the Department of Education headquarters in support of SurvJustice, Equal Rights Advocates and the Victim Rights Law Center, three law firms who filed a lawsuit against DeVos. The lawsuit alleges that the Department of Education discriminated against students who report sexual assault by rescinding the Dear Colleague Letter, an Obama-era guideline advising universities on how to address campus sexual assault. In September, DeVos issued her highly controversial decision to rescind these guidelines. One tenet of the guidelines was the suggested 60-day window to resolve cases of sexual assault. Wellons criticized the University for failing to address her case within this window. “In December 2016, I reported my sexual assault and stalking and it is now February 2018 and I

The Student Government Association (SGA) unanimously passed the Title IX Policy Resolution, calling for the University to reform the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE), at their weekly meeting on Tuesday. Junior Class Senators Miranda Bannister and Madelynn Wellons, who introduced the bill, said that the average time it takes for OIE to close an investigation is 128 days, according to the OIE’s annual statistics report. The resolution calls for the University to reduce the average duration of an investigation to comply with the Title IX federal standard of 60 days. “OIE is messed up, and that’s just the shortest, most complete way I can say it,” Wellons said. “It’s a broken institution at this school. Something needs to be done, and the administration isn’t taking it seriously.” Bannister believes that OIE staff members have lost focus of what is relevant. “They’re investigating nitty gritty details that oftentimes are more targeted

A private police force This April, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan approved the Community Strengthening Act, a bill that will allow Hopkins to establish a private police force over a multiyear process. The month-long occupation of Garland Hall in protest of the JHPD’s creation ended on May 8 with the arrests of seven people, including four students. According to the Community Strengthening Act, the JHPD must formalize a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) prior to its launch. The MOU will set out the terms of the JHPD’s jurisdictional and operational constraints.

Editor’s Note: This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available. Baltimore Police officers arrested seven people — including four students — who were part of a month-long sit-in at Garland Hall on Wednesday morning. Students and community members have been holding a sit-in at Garland Hall to protest the creation of a private police force and the University’s contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement since April 3. At around 11 a.m., a spokesperson for the Baltimore City State's Attorney Office announced that the office will not prosecute those arrested. Later on Wednesday afternoon, those arrested were released from Central Booking and Intake Center without charges or bail. Police said they arrested five of the protesters for trespassing and two others for impeding vehicle traffic.

In July, Hopkins announced that a search committee would be formed to hire a new Vice President (VP) for Security. In addition to overseeing the entire 1,200 personnel security force for Hopkins, the future administrator will be leading and developing the planned private police force. The position became vacant following the departure of former VP for Security Melissa Hyatt, who became Baltimore County’s first female police chief in June. Connor Scott, who formerly served as chief of staff for security, is currently the acting VP. Although made up mainly of administrators and trustees, the committee also includes community activists, students, a professor and a resident at Hopkins Hospital. Kendall Free, an undergraduate student and president of the Black Student Union, directly sits on the committee. She stated that Dean of Student Life Smita Ruzicka recommended her for the position.

Provost Sunil Kumar and Interim Vice Provost for Institutional Equity Joy Gaslevic emailed the student body on Tuesday with the Office of Institutional Equity’s (OIE) second annual report and the results of the recent Campus Climate Survey. Although the University has commissioned prior climate surveys, this survey was produced in collaboration with the Association of American Universities (AAU) so that the data collected on incidents of sexual misconduct at the University could be compared against the data produced by 32 other participating college campuses. The University hired Westat, a Maryland-based research firm, to administer the survey and compile the report. About one third of Hopkins undergraduates and one quarter of Hopkins graduate students responded to the survey. The recently released OIE annual report quantifies the reports that OIE received of sexual misconduct this year, along with the University’s response. Gaslevic summarized her office’s main takeaways from these two reports in

“Unfortunately, I cannot say that during my time at Hopkins I have felt supported as a [First-Generation, Limited-Income (FLI)] student by the University as a whole. Over time, the University has started to recognize the struggles that FLI students face, but it has been a slow process to correct these issues.” These are the words of senior Felicia Petterway, student representative of the FLI Network. Launched during the summer of 2018, the Network is comprised of students, staff and faculty. Its purpose is to promote solidarity and belonging among students who are from low-income families or who are the first in their family to attend college. The Network will host National First-Generation College Student Day this Friday, Nov 8.

Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and alumnus of the Class of 1964, announced today that he will donate $1.8 billion to the University. The gift, which will be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid, is the largest donation to any U.S. college or university in history. The donation will allow the University to permanently conduct need-blind admissions, which means that family income will not be considered in the admissions process. Hopkins will also eliminate student loans from financial aid packages and instead offer scholarships that do not need to be repaid, beginning fall 2019. For spring 2019, the University will offer immediate loan relief to undergraduates whose financial aid package includes a federal need-based loan. Currently, over 44 percent of Hopkins students graduate with loan debt, which averages above $24,000. In an interview with The News-Letter, University President Ronald J.

By ISABELLA PARK                                                     | September 19, 2019
The Life Design Lab, previously the Homewood Career Center, is now focusing on allowing students to identify their strong areas of interests and inspiration and experimenting with them to advance their career. This marks a departure from the previous center, which was primarily based around career planning and the job search. The Life Design Lab has also moved from a transaction-based service model, where students signed up for one-on-one advisor meetings and which required a high number of staff and individual staff hours, to a more connection-based and community-based learning, in order to engage more students. To this end, the University has reorganized the Life Design Lab around fields of study. Staff members with the Life Design Lab have been redeployed to each of the departments across the Whiting School of Engineering and the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and are now referred to as life design educators.

 SGA provides free laundry for on-campus residents - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By CLAIRE GOUDREAU                                                     | September 12, 2019
As of this semester, all students living in Homewood dorms will be given a monthly allotment of $27 in laundry cash, which translates to 18 wash or dry cycles. The $27 in laundry cash that students receive comes directly from their existing housing fees. Previously, students had to spend $1.50 for each cycle, but with the new inclusive policy they are no longer required to pay any extra charge. Student Government Association (SGA) Senior Class President Pavan Patel, who spearheaded the initiative, told The News-Letter that it was all part of an effort to improve the student body’s quality of life. “Laundry is a basic necessity that everyone at Hopkins needs, especially people who don’t have as many resources,“ Patel said. “Something as small as laundry could pose a burden, so we wanted to make sure that students could focus on their academics and not have to worry about these

 Refuel Our Future holds first Fossil Free Friday - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Refuel Our Future (Refuel) held the first Fossil Fuel Friday demonstration from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. on the steps of Gilman Hall last Friday. The group said that it will continue holding such demonstrations weekly until the University divests itself from the fossil fuel industry. The Hopkins board of trustees voted to divest itself from companies that produce thermal coal in December 2017, following six years of Refuel’s campaigning and a recommendation by the Public Interest Investment Advisory Committee. The demonstrators are demanding that the University divest itself more fully. At the event, Refuel executive board member Jeremy Berger, a junior, said that the decision to divest just from thermal coal was too small a measure. “Hopkins divested from thermal coal a couple of years ago, which is like divesting from Blockbuster Video. It is anachronistic and they should divest from all fossil fuels,” Berger said. Refuel organizer Elly

The Hopkins School of Medicine confirmed on Sept. 18 that it would be ending its controversial training contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This contract was held through the Center for Law Enforcement Medicine. However, at the time, some students questioned the accuracy and implications of this announcement. The News-Letter reached out to University officials to discuss the rationale behind choosing not to renew the contracts on Monday. According to Hopkins Medicine Senior Director of Public Relations and Corporate Communications Kim Hoppe, the decision stemmed from administrative issues. “Decisions about whether to seek and renew contracts depend on a multitude of factors,” Hoppe wrote in an email to The News-Letter. “In this case, due to complications related to the contracting process, including some delays in notification by the agency regarding its intentions, the Department of Emergency Medicine had to reallocate the substantial resources required to manage the program to

The Student Government Association (SGA) met this past Tuesday for their weekly meeting to discuss the difficulties regarding student elections this semester, as well as SGA’s role in the Sex Week planned for April. During the public input period of the meeting, a large group of student leaders met with SGA to broach concerns with club restructuring and budget allocations with the recent audit led by SGA and Student Leadership and Involvement (SLI). Senators expressed frustration with the lack of forewarning of the election application deadline. The Committee of Student Elections (CSE) sent out an email last Sunday that stated that mandated information sessions for candidates were scheduled for the next immediate two days. Junior Class Senator William Cho expressed his discomfort that the election turned out to be incumbent-heavy. He questioned the possibility of a special election with write-ins. “People only had one or two days to decide whether

The Student Government Association (SGA) held their final meeting of the semester on Tuesday, confirming the Committee on Student Organizations’s (CSO’s) audit decisions and passing several additional pieces of legislation. The CSO audit examined over 100 student organizations. Their decisions included deactivating 11 groups. Clubs were picked for deactivation either because of a failure to meet with SGA for the audit or an inability to pass the audit. The organizations being deactivated are the 22nd Century Interplanetary Diplomacy Club, ERUPTION, Jam Sessions, the Mahjong Club, the Modern Dance Company, Health Guardians of America, Students for Justice in Palestine, Take Back the Tap, The Dialectic, Throat Culture and VIVAZ. Senior Class Senator Chase McAdams, who introduced the bill, said that he stands firmly in favor of deactivating these clubs, most of which fail to meet the requirement of having 10 members. “This was very clearly communicated multiple times throughout the semester.

University President Ronald J. Daniels announced in an email to the student body on Wednesday, March 18 that in-person classes and University events are suspended through the rest of the spring semester due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. This year’s commencement, he added, will be held virtually. On Tuesday, March 10, Daniels had announced that Hopkins would be canceling in-person classes and transitioning all undergraduate courses to remote instruction through at least April 12. His March 18 email extends this transition through the end of the spring semester. Students will be credited, he wrote, for the balance of their housing and dining contracts. “Community transmission of the virus is accelerating nationally and within our region, and we continue to be guided by public health authorities and infectious disease and epidemiological experts at Johns Hopkins who are now urging all of us to observe stricter social distancing protocols for a

All residential students must leave campus by 5 p.m. on March 15. Vice Provost for Student Affairs Alanna Shanahan emailed all students who live in University housing by Friday instructing them to vacate residential buildings. The email stated that there would be certain exceptions for those “who cannot return home due to international travel restrictions, financial hardship or other extraordinary circumstances.” The announcement, sent through the Housing Office, follows the University’s announcement on Tuesday, March 10 that Hopkins will be suspending in-person classes through at least April 12 due to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. For the time they are not on campus, Shanahan wrote, students will be credited for their housing and dining costs. “We are taking these steps after consulting with experts in public health and infectious disease who advised us to significantly reduce the number of students residing on campus in highly concentrated living, dining and studying

Following the cancellation of in-person classes through the rest of the semester as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, student organizations have been forced to adapt their processes. Members of these student groups spoke with The News-Letter to explain how they have handled the pandemic. Sophomore Kylie Sharron, external training director for A Place to Talk (APTT), a peer listening group on campus, explained that the move to remote learning has severed the essential face-to-face interaction aspect of the organization. “We are working diligently to figure out a means to continue to connect with the student body throughout the chaos of the rest of this semester,” Sharron said. Another organization that faces similar problems with transitioning to a virtual platform is the Sexual Assault Resource Unit (SARU), a student-run advocacy group that supports survivors of sexual violence. SARU Co-Director Reah Vasilakopoulos, a senior, stated the in-person space that SARU

Nearly two years ago, then-sophomores Bridget Chen and Chanel Lee founded the student group Wings, with hopes of bringing free and accessible menstrual products to Hopkins. This Monday, Wings launched the Menstrual Products Initiative (MPI) pilot program, installing free tampon and pad dispensers in eight women’s restrooms and two all-gender restrooms across Homewood Campus. The pilot program, scheduled to end on April 20, is funded by the Office of Women and Gender Resources and co-sponsored by the Office of the Dean of Student Life. According to Lee, the dispensers will be restocked at least twice a week by 30 student volunteers. Facilities and Custodial Services, Lee added, will assist these efforts. Lee underscored the need to destigmatize periods and promote menstrual health on campus. “Do we talk about periods in regular conversations? No, we don’t, because it’s almost embarrassing, even when it’s a naturally occurring bodily function,” they said. “When

Feminine hygiene products will be available in the women’s restrooms in Brody Learning Commons (Brody Atrium, Q-Level and M-Level), in the Fresh Food Café (FFC) and outside Nolan’s. In addition, students will be able to find them at front desks of Levering Café, Mattin Center and the Recreation Center. At the start of every week, each desk will receive 20 tampons and 20 pads, and each restroom 28 tampons and 28 pads. The SGA will refill the desk locations once a week and the restroom locations every three days. The bill was partly inspired by an article written for The News-Letter in 2014 titled “Campus feminine hygiene supply is inadequate.” In the article, Will Marcus criticizes the lack of selection and high cost of feminine products sold on campus. He also argues that the lack of accessibility and availability of hygiene products makes buying them an unnecessary and major inconvenience.

While menstruation is a normal and regular bodily process, restrooms on the Homewood Campus do not provide menstrual products — a necessity for around half the population. To address this, juniors Chanel Lee and Bridget Chen founded the student group Wings to bring free and accessible menstrual products to campus. Lee explained why they felt it was important to fight for better access to menstrual products. “It’s immoral to tax a normal human bodily function. Menstrual products are not easily available and affordable to everyone. That is a fact,“ Lee said. “They are expensive, especially when buying on a routine basis.” On Nov. 8, 2016, Student Government Association (SGA) members passed a bill to have free menstrual health products available in women’s restrooms. Junior Class President Dean Chien explained that it took the SGA Senate a month to figure out how to implement the bill. They created a small committee

In an email addressed to the Hopkins community, University President Ronald J. Daniels announced that the University will face serious financial challenges as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Daniels expressed gratitude for affiliates’ rapid response to changes made to the academic year, but did not shy away from the daunting monetary effects the virus will have on employment, aid, research and salaries. “Our university is not immune to the very serious negative effects of COVID-19. Today, I write to speak frankly with you about the substantial financial challenges our university is confronting and the measures we are undertaking to meet them, including actions that will directly and significantly affect our employees,” the email states. According to a more detailed report of financial projections, the University is expected to lose over $100 million for the 2020 fiscal year. These losses account for: loss in tuition and student-related revenues (assuming

The University’s 2020 Research Workgroup held its second town hall on May 20. The event’s purpose was to encourage feedback on the Workgroup’s guidelines for resuming research this year. The Workgroup is currently examining the impact of lab management and safety strategies during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and has helped develop a three-phase reopening plan. The guidelines give advice for phase one for restarting research on campus. According to the document, the University is currently in phase zero, which allows only research related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to occur. In the final and third stage, there will be a full return of research operations. Phase one, which the University hopes to begin soon, refers to an increase of research activity with a low on-campus density. Research groups will not meet in person and there will be no shared offices. However, labs will be shared with a density of one

The University shared a draft plan for Phase Two of its reopening in an email to Hopkins affiliates on Dec. 18. The plan is intended to go into effect when the spring semester begins on Jan. 25 and will replace the Phase One plans implemented during the fall semester. The release of the draft guide, however, does not signify that Hopkins has determined whether to carry out the proposed hybrid reopening plans. The final decision will be made during the week of Jan. 4. Stephen Gange, executive vice provost for academic affairs, and Jane Schlegel, vice president and chief administrative officer, emphasized in the email that ensuring the health and safety of all affiliates requires a community effort. “Moving to an expanded operating posture at the appropriate time is a challenge that will require the help of every member of our community, but our experience so far gives us confidence

In an email to undergraduate students and their families on August 23, University leaders disclosed that a small cluster of students living in off-campus housing in Charles Village had tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) after returning to Baltimore. According to the email, the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Call Center (JHCCC) is currently conducting a contact investigation to determine whether additional students have been exposed to the virus. In an interview with The News-Letter, junior and Charles Village resident Mario Aguirre said that after reading the email, he and his friends decided to take extra precautions to limit possible exposure to the virus. However, he also condemned the email’s lack of immediate information. “Hopkins should have given us more data about the COVID cases so we could better protect ourselves,” he said. “Right now there’s a real lack of leadership and communication.

The dining experience for students living on-campus has been adapted to adhere to social-distancing guidelines due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Nolan’s on 33rd, normally open only for dinner service, now serves three meals a day to the few students living in on-campus housing. Operations run from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., with break periods in between service to sanitize. In an interview with The News-Letter, Senior Manager of Dining Programs Ian Magowan explained that various safety precautions have been implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “We wanted to eliminate as many touch points as possible. At the entrance we give all students bags for their food that already have silverware in them,” he said. “All lines are long and singular, all condiments are prepackaged and all food is handed to them.” Seats have been removed from Nolan’s, and typical full food service is offered only as takeout.

By JACQUI NEBER The University has made many changes this year to its dining programs at Nolan’s on 33rd (Nolan’s), Fresh Food Cafe (FFC) and Charles Street Market (CharMar) in order to increase variety and convenience for students across campus. Nolan’s has undergone perhaps the most changes, with new food stations added along with an expanded variety of meals available at each station. Two new stations for students to enjoy include Rustic Plate, which advertises regional and international offerings, and Ciao Amici, an Italian speciality station. Director of Dining Programs Bill Connor described feedback the dining program has received from students as well as some of the improvements made to Nolan’s. “The one piece of constant feedback in previous years from students who dined at Nolan’s was the desire for the Dining Program to offer more variety and frequent opportunities for menu change,” Connor wrote in an email to The

Hopkins welcomed students back on campus for its hybrid spring reopening with limited in-person activities and housing. Students are required to adhere to a number of safety protocols related to COVID-19, including a mask mandate and asymptomatic testing. The move-in process for University housing began on Jan. 16. Additional rules residential students must follow include mandatory biweekly testing, face coverings and social distancing. Mass gatherings are prohibited, and students are not allowed to enter residential buildings or dorm rooms not assigned to them. There is a blanket ban on having any guests, including other residential students, inside rooms. Freshman Jason Lin stated that he has been able to safely socialize with classmates he had previously only interacted with on Zoom. “There are obviously some restrictions, but the way the University has the guidelines set up, social interaction is still possible,” he said. “Overall, I found that the move-in process and

Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott lifted the ban on indoor and outdoor dining in Baltimore on Wednesday, announcing that eateries can reopen for dining at limited capacity beginning at 6 a.m. on Friday, Jan. 22. In a news conference at Park Height’s Zeta Center, Scott justified lifting the ban, citing the city’s decrease in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Since the risk for COVID-19 transmission is greater indoors, the new rules on dining state that restaurants and bars will be limited to 50% capacity outdoors and 25% capacity indoors. Bars and breweries that do not serve food will be able to reopen for the first time since November. Additionally, restaurants are required to maintain sign-in and sign-out sheets for guests to assist with contact tracing and diners will only be permitted to stay for one hour. Scott has also issued guidelines on other recreational activities, including gyms, which can host classes with

In response to the pandemic, the University altered its spring break schedule to minimize traveling off campus. Instead of granting students an entire week off, the University scheduled five days without classes interspersed throughout the semester. So far, students have had two of their five spring break days and, although they have found ways to enjoy their days off, the move has raised concerns about mental health. Junior Dmytro Nebesh, the president of the mental health and well-being organization Peabuddies, believes that the University did not do enough to ensure that students could rest on break days. “We’re not really given time off. We’re just given time off from Zoom,” he said. “Especially at Peabody, there are rehearsals [and] lessons still scheduled. I have a separate job, and I thought on break day I would get a day off, and then I found out I [didn’t].” Nebesh tried to plan

Moving to a new city presents the opportunity to explore a brand-new culinary landscape. Other than national trends, much of the identity of a city’s food culture is characteristic of its economic history, immigration patterns and community bonding through food. Though it can be daunting to find all the best places to take friends to show your local know-how, hopefully this guide gives you an updated look at what’s good and what’s special (all for a night out under $15). If I were to host an impromptu weekend visit from family, the very first place I’d take them is Federal Hill, around the southern edge of the harbor. The neighborhood is one of the oldest in the city, with beautiful brick townhomes and a historic-yet-updated vibe. Along the area of Light and Cross Street you’ll find a packed block of diverse foods, including some personal favorites like Byblos Lebanese (a

It can be difficult to explore outside your college campus whilst managing a busy schedule. But it is possible to find time to spend with friends outside of the tight confinements of the Hopkins campus. Every year, at least one senior will tell you something along the lines of “don’t get stuck in the Hopkins bubble.” But what does this even mean? Given that the campus is located in a cultural city with plenty of food vendors to visit and unique architecture to see, it would be a shame to not experience the city outside of campus during your undergraduate years. Grades tend to play a major role in a lot of our identities; it’s too easy to get sucked into work and school and, without realizing it, find that the time has flown by. So, I’m here as an upperclassman to give YOU some simple tips on how to

It truly was another unprecedented summer. As vaccines became more readily available and COVID-19 cases in Baltimore declined this past June, Hopkins relaxed its indoor mask mandate and weekly testing policies. Many students felt optimistic that the fall would represent as close a return to normal as possible. The second half of this idealized “shot girl summer” presented a reality check. With a rise in cases associated with the delta variant, Hopkins reinstated indoor masking. Just this week, the University reversed course and told fully vaccinated students living off-campus that they would need to be tested once a week. With so much change, is the phrase “So good to be back” a statement of truth, or one of sarcasm? Though the blue and green interior is familiar, Brody feels more like a Zoom cafe than a hangout spot. Freshmen still look to meal times as opportunities to socialize, but they

The Mattin Center will soon be leveled to make room for the construction of the new student center, which is scheduled to open in fall 2024. Designed by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, the same firm designing the Barack Obama Presidential Center, the four buildings that make up Mattin have served the arts community on the Homewood Campus since 2001. According to Alanna Klos, project manager at Hopkins Facilities and Real Estate, the demolition of the Mattin Center is slated to begin in late May and will be completed by the end of the fall semester.

The statue Spirit of Music, located south of the Mattin Center, was erected last week to commemorate the late Hopkins student Rex Chao. Chao was shot and killed in close proximity to the Milton S. Eisenhower Library by fellow student Robert J. Harwood on April 10, 1996. Walking back to their respective dorms from a College Republicans meeting, Harwood shot Chao twice with a .357 Magnum after becoming engrossed in an argument. In response to the tragic event, the Rex Chao Memorial Committee was created in 1996 to honor the memory of Chao. Former girlfriend Suzanne Hubbard and close friend AmyClair Brusch co-chaired the committee, with the support of five other close friends of Chao. The committee focused on raising money in order to memorialize their friend and fellow student. Over the past six years, the committee has raised more than $70,000 to cover the statue, the base and other

Blue Jays off to 4-1 start in Centennial - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

The Blue Jays bested the McDaniel Green Terror this past Tuesday, achieving a 9-5 victory, the result of a combination of strong Hopkins play, as well as several McDaniel errors. The Blue Jays have moved to 13-8-2 on the season, and 4-1 in the Centennial as the Blue Jays enter their second week of Conference play. Contrasting Hopkins's strong start, scoring nine runs in the first four innings, McDaniel started the game very poorly, setting a tone that would be prevalent for almost the entire game This tone was reflected in a first-inning error, which allowed the Blue Jays to scoot ahead 2-0. In the second inning, a passed ball saw junior second baseman Adam Weiner reach scoring position, and he eventually scored to extend the lead to three runs. Two more runs were scored in the third inning off of sophomore Mike Denlinger's first career home run, giving Hopkins

May 3, 2012 When I started writing this column in the beginning of the year, it was a simple procedure: I wanted to write about stuff I liked, not necessarily what was being covered. When I was talking to my editors, the idea of Low Culture was really appealing. I like network TV and popcorn movies. I like superhero comic books and shoot 'em up video games. And, at first, I was pretty convinced the active word was the "TV" or the "movie" aspects, when really I was talking about the "network" or "popcorn" aspects. Artsy films? Oscar-winning stuff? HBO or AMC dramas? Even indie video games, music or comics? That's not what Low Culture is about. Low Culture is about the everyday stuff, and finding the magic in it. Watching Family Guy or Community not for the cinematography, but to laugh. And, yes, those jokes are meaningful. They make

May 3, 2012 This single of the week, "Doom," is brought to you by Brooklyn-based band New Beard. "Doom" is off their new album, New Beard City. New Beard is comprised of frontman Ben Wigler, drummer Tony Waldman, tubist TubaJoe Exley (no, I'm not kidding) and one-named Yazan, the guitarist. New Beard has also recently added a new member (and instrument!) to the mix: Maria Christina Eisen, on saxophone. It seems as though New Beard is set on defying any definitive genre type. With influences from bands ranging from Elliot Smith to Megadeath and genres from folk to progressive rock, it is clear that New Beard is anything but typical. Their producer, Gustav Ejstes of Dungen, adds synthesizer to their music and puts the final, eclectic touch on the album.Frontman Wigler also has considerable experience to add to the group from his days with his previous band, Arizona.

SGA falls short with election remedy - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

May 3, 2012 A recent amendment passed by the SGA details clearer rules governing the conduct by members of the SGA during elections. Prior to this amendment, SGA members were only advised to maintain appropriate behavior during elections. Unlike candidates vying for a position on SGA, current members did not have concrete guidelines under the Committee on Student Elections (CSE). This page agrees that increased clarity and transparency is needed in the rules governing the behavior of current SGA members in order to maintain the integrity of the elections each year. The amendment states that, "members of the SGA should be held to a higher standard pursuant to the office they were elected to." The background of an SGA member merits increased standards during elections. We believe that the amendment should go further, addressing concrete points to level the playing field. The SGA should work to decrease negative campaigning and

The University released the final designs for the student center on Nov. 2. The facility is scheduled to open in fall 2024 and will serve as a non-academic space for students and student organizations, featuring auditoriums, digital labs, dining options and areas for relaxation. Plans to build a new student center were first announced in March 2019. The University has since worked to collect student input, surveying 1,200 University affiliates in June to help choose the design. The student center’s 150,000-square-foot design was created by Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) and will be built where the Mattin Center currently stands. The final design was selected by the Student Center Advisory Committee, which is made up of 25 faculty members, staff, students and alumni and chaired by Vice Provost for Student Affairs Alanna Shanahan. In an interview with The News-Letter, senior Simi Aluko expressed excitement for the new building. “I really love

University administrators announced updates to its fall health guidelines in an email broadcast yesterday. In line with changes to the citywide mask mandate, individuals who upload proof of vaccination will no longer be required to wear masks indoors or outdoors and may also eat and drink without social distancing. Testing for vaccinated individuals will be required only once a week. The decision is consistent with several peer institutions. Ivy League schools like Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania have lifted the mask mandate for vaccinated individuals. In an interview with The News-Letter, incoming freshman Sofia Melamed said that she is not surprised by the relaxation of guidelines given that the public health situation has improved considerably in Maryland. “Restrictions are only needed [when] COVID-19 infections are putting significant strain on the healthcare system,” she said. “At the moment, they are not in the United States and Maryland in particular.” National

Baltimore City Mayor Brandon Scott announced on June 16 that the citywide mask mandate and state of emergency will be lifted as of July 1. Scott noted that businesses and workplaces will be allowed to continue their own mask mandates. These new mask guidelines came the day after Maryland Governor Larry Hogan did the same for the state. Rising sophomore Jabari Lawrence agreed with the decision to lift the mandate but was unsure why July 1 was the chosen date. “It seems like decisions to lift mandates recently have been a bit arbitrary,” he said. “I just wish they would explain why they decide these particular dates. I think people would be much less confused and taken aback if they did.” Rising sophomore Ilana Chalom does not plan on changing her masking behavior. “I still wear my mask everywhere,” she said.

University leaders announced updates to the University’s fall semester COVID-19 policies in an email to constituents on Wednesday. The broadcast reiterated the vaccination requirement for students announced in April and extended the mandate to all faculty and staff. Barring religious or medical exemptions, all Hopkins affiliates will be required to upload their proof of vaccination by August 1 through the University’s COVID-19 vaccine registration system, which will be launched July 1. International students will be eligible for free vaccinations upon their arrival to Hopkins and have until September 30 to submit proof of vaccination. As of June 12, Maryland’s vaccination rate of 50.6% is seven percentage points ahead of the national rate. However, only 40.0% of Baltimore residents are fully vaccinated. Hopkins is not alone in requiring vaccinations: Many peer institutions — including Stanford University, Emory University and all eight Ivy League schools — are also mandating vaccinations for all

Hopkins announced plans on Friday to largely return to normal this fall. Most classes will be held in person, and COVID-19 vaccines will be required for students. On-campus housing will be open at near-full capacity, and residency requirements will be reinstated for freshmen and sophomores. Administrators will determine face covering requirements based on public health conditions closer to the fall. Junior Sylvana Schaffer supports the University’s decision. “This is basically the best announcement Hopkins has made since the beginning of the pandemic,” she said. “After three semesters of largely virtual education, I think that bringing students back to campus and returning to largely in-person learning is vital.” Sophomore Andrea Guillen called on the University to provide more information about student organization activities. “There is no information about clubs, which I would really appreciate,” she said. “One of my clubs, the Witness Theatre Company, is struggling right now to find space

Throughout the hybrid spring semester, Hopkins has established isolation and quarantine housing for students who test positive for COVID-19 or come into close contact with someone who tested positive. There are currently 343 rooms reserved for this purpose at AMR III, the McCoy Hall, the Inn at the Colonnade and an additional Hopkins-owned property. Isolation housing is used for COVID-19-positive students, while quarantine housing is for those who have had a meaningful contact with a person who tested positive. As of Friday, both isolation and quarantine housing are largely empty, with seven isolation housing units in use. According to Assistant Vice President of External Relations for the Office of Communications Karen Lancaster, students who test positive will receive a call from a HelWell nurse with instructions to relocate. The nurse will regularly follow up on physical and emotional health until the end of the isolation period. Similar processes occur for

The spring semester is a small step closer to the pre-pandemic college experience as a select number of courses have become in-person and limited on-campus activities resume. In-person classes, however, faced hiccups as they were first pushed back due to severe winter weather and then were suspended after two days due to a surge in positive COVID-19 cases among students. Suspension of in-person classes and activities was extended twice but resumed on Feb. 12. Due to bad weather, the University shut down this Thursday, and in-person classes were suspended once again. Sophomore Sarah Ann Duck expressed frustration about the frequent suspension of in-person activities, particularly her psychology research. “I was unable to do any research last semester due to the COVID-19 restrictions and have been hoping that I will be able to begin this semester,“ she said. “Thursday was the fourth week in a row that my start date got

In an email to Hopkins affiliates, University administrators announced that the suspension of in-person classes and activities will be extended until Thursday, Feb. 11. Small gatherings — indoors and outdoors — are prohibited, including outdoor walks with a small group of friends, according to Assistant Vice President of External Relations for the Office of Communications Karen Lancaster. Some previously announced measures, however, have been relaxed. Students living in Charles Commons are now allowed to leave quarantine and no longer have to get daily COVID-19 tests. Student athletes still have to be tested every day and remain in their residences. All other undergraduate students have to be tested three times a week. New student COVID-19 cases peaked at 44 with a 3% positivity rate and have since decreased significantly. Fewer tests have been conducted since Thursday, when nearly 2,500 tests were administered, but the positivity rate has also gone down to

NOVID, an organization that branches off of the social enterprise Expii, was founded by Carnegie Mellon University mathematics professor Po-Shen Loh, who had made a moral commitment to apply his expertise to national emergencies. On March 14, he was called upon to help the nation during the pandemic. Using his expertise in network theory, Loh developed the NOVID app, a novel tool to help limit the transmission of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Loh announced the approval of the app on iOS and Android this May. In an interview with The News-Letter, Loh explained the rationale behind his contact tracing app. “One of the parts of COVID-19 that’s so bad is it spreads before you know you have it,” Loh said. “How do we find a way to reduce the spread if it’s spreading invisibly? That’s how the idea for building the network came in.” NOVID users self-report positive COVID-19 cases, which

The University updated its previous announcement about the recent COVID-19 outbreak on campus in an email on Thursday, Feb. 4. According to the email, 58 students have now tested positive for the virus — a drastic increase from the 38 known cases recorded on Wednesday. Last week, only seven students tested positive. The University amended its COVID-19 policies in light of the outbreak. All undergraduate students are now required to get tested three times a week, with student athletes and residents of Charles Common getting tested every day. Additionally, all in-person activities and classes are suspended through Friday, Feb. 5. In an email to The News-Letter, Karen Lancaster, assistant vice president of external relations for the Office of Communications, confirmed that all students who tested positive have been moved to isolation housing.

The University resumed in-person classes and lifted the ban on indoor and outdoor gatherings on Thursday, Feb. 11. The ban, which followed a COVID-19 cluster caused by a party at the North Charles Social Club (WAWA), began on Wednesday, Feb. 3 and had been extended twice since the University’s initial communication of the outbreak. New guidelines include a five-person limit for on- and off-campus gatherings and mandatory COVID-19 testing three times a week. Students under stay-at-home orders are now permitted to leave their residences, but students in isolation housing must remain there. In an email to The News-Letter, junior Michelle Lee, who is currently living off-campus, described the increased testing policy as excessive. “I understand the logic behind getting tested three times a week, but I feel like I barely even have enough time to get tested twice a week,” she wrote. “There should be an option for people who

Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced on Monday that all residents 16 and older are eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at mass vaccination sites, effective April 6. This change is based on an anticipated increase in supplies from the federal government. The state will require other providers to offer COVID-19 vaccines starting April 12. In a press conference announcing the update, Hogan expressed hope that Maryland will be able to move quickly and vaccinate as many people as possible. “Even though we’re opening up eligibility for everyone, that does not mean everyone will be able to immediately get an appointment,” he said. “If [the federal government] continues to provide vaccines the way they’ve led us to believe, we should be able to finish everybody who wants one during April and May.” This announcement comes alongside President Joe Biden’s decision to move up the deadline for states to make all Americans

As Maryland moves into phase 1C of its COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan, over two million Marylanders are now eligible for the vaccine. Phase 1C expands vaccine eligibility to people over 65 and more essential workers in lab services, agriculture and manufacturing. The state government website reports that the federal government is currently providing Maryland approximately 10,000 doses daily, far below the current demand. Because of this transition, more Hopkins affiliates are getting vaccinated. In an email to University affiliates on Jan. 22, Provost Sunil Kumar and Interim Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration Mary Miller noted the ongoing efforts to support eligible Hopkins affiliates and Baltimore residents in receiving the vaccine. Hopkins Hospital has established a partnership with the Baltimore City Public Schools to help vaccinate K-12 teachers and staff. The Hospital is also pursuing a program focused on senior citizens in nursing and assisted-living facilities in Baltimore. “As

Last week, some Hopkins undergraduates began volunteering at M&T Bank Stadium, one of three mass vaccination sites in Baltimore, to offer non-clinical support services through the Vaccine Volunteer Project. The COVID-19 working group of the office of University President Ronald J. Daniels partnered with the Center for Social Concern (CSC) and the state of Maryland to launch the project. According to CSC Executive Director Misti McKeehen, this partnership was conceived in order to extend the University’s COVID-19 response beyond the immediate community of Hopkins and into Baltimore and Maryland. “As we identified the mass vaccination sites with the state of Maryland, Vice Provost [Alanna] Shanahan was asked to dedicate Student Affairs support,” she said. “That’s where I had the pleasure of coming in to assist with the planning and implementation of the large, long-term volunteer effort that will take quite a bit of coordination in the coming months.” Shifts are

The University announced in an email to the student body on August 27 that all fully vaccinated undergraduate students living both on and off-campus will need to be tested once a week. Previously, fully vaccinated students living off-campus were not required to be tested. Those with approved exemptions to the vaccine regulations will still need to be tested twice a week. Additionally, pregnancy will no longer be an accepted exception to the vaccine mandate. Students can schedule a COVID-19 test through MyChart, with testing locations available at Shriver Hall, Charles Commons and AMR II on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. In an interview with The News-Letter, junior Melody Lee emphasized that while she does feel more at ease with the new protocols, weekly testing is still inconvenient for some students. “I do live right next to Commons, so it is not as bad for me compared to other

In a reversal from previous fall semester masking guidelines, the University announced earlier today that it will reimpose the indoor masking mandate and reinstate social distancing requirements for indoor dining. According to the email, the policies will take effect August 5 for all affiliates, regardless of vaccination status. Baltimore City Mayor Brandon Scott reinstated the city's indoor mask mandate as well, it will take effect across Baltimore on Monday, August 9 at 9 a.m. Exceptions to the University’s renewed mask mandate include in single-occupancy and shared office settings where 6-foot distancing can be maintained; among roommates in residence halls, dorms, suites and apartments; and while eating and drinking at least 6 feet from another person. The Office of the Provost may also approve exceptions in instructional settings if provided with pedagogic rationale and sufficient distancing is possible. In an email to The News-Letter, Senior Media Relations Representative Jill Rosen stated

 University to only accept FDA-approved vaccines - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

In a reversal from previously declared policy, the University announced in an email on August 19 that it will only accept COVID-19 vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which currently includes the Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccines. The University had previously stated that it would accept World Health Organization (WHO) approved vaccines, such as Oxford/AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, Sinovax, Covishield or Novavax. However, the administration claimed that they did not view these vaccines as effective against the more aggressive and highly prevalent delta variant. As a result, those who have received non-FDA-approved vaccines are required to get re-vaccinated with those that are approved by the FDA. Vice President for Communications Andrew Green noted in an email to The News-Letter that students needing to get re-vaccinated will be under the same health restrictions as unvaccinated individuals. “Students who require re-vaccination will be allowed on campus and to participate

The Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) has been at the center of public debate since the University first announced its plans to create a private police force in 2018. In 2019, protesters chained themselves to stairwells in Garland Hall to protest the planned police force. The sit-in lasted for a month and ended with the arrest of seven people, four of whom were students. Hopkins students also marched with residents of Douglass Homes, a public housing complex near the Hopkins Hospital, and local activist organizations to protest the potential introduction of the JHPD into the community. In 2020, the marble sign on the Merrick Gateway and parts of the Mattin Center were spray-painted with messages such as “Justice 4 Floyd” and “No JHUPD” following nationwide protests against police brutality. In late June of that year, students and community groups also marched to the home of University President Ronald J. Daniels

 We need to address crime, but creating a Hopkins police department is not the solution - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

This past Monday, with no prior warning, Hopkins students received an email from University President Ronald J. Daniels and CEO of Hopkins Medicine Paul B. Rothman regarding a bill that is being introduced this week in the Maryland General Assembly. The bill “would give private colleges and universities in Baltimore City the authority to work with the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) to create a university police department.” This University police department would function alongside the pre-existing Hopkins security team, and it would be “developed and implemented through a detailed agreement with the BPD.” The school hopes to still consult faculty, students, staff and community representatives to help develop what they hope will become a “model university police department.” This email came as a surprise to students, and seems to raise more questions than it answers. It is unclear whether the the University police would be a branch of the BPD,

Over 200 members of the Hopkins and Baltimore community protested the creation of a Hopkins private police force, as well as the University’s contracts with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), on Wednesday in Wyman Park Dell. Shortly after the rally, demonstrators marched to University President Ronald J. Daniels’ house. They then continued on to Garland Hall, where members of Students Against Private Police (SAPP) and the Hopkins Coalition against ICE were holding a 24-hour sit-in that had begun earlier that afternoon. These protests responded to the final approval of the Community Safety and Strengthening Act, which the Maryland General Assembly passed on April 1. This legislation will allow the University to create its own police force. Several other organizations, including National Nurses United (NNU), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), CASA de Maryland and Baltimore Democratic Socialists of America also participated in the rally.

On Saturday, residents of Douglass Homes, a public housing complex near Hopkins Hospital, protested the University’s alleged interest in purchasing the complex and the potential introduction of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) into the community. In addition to tenants of Douglass Homes, several local activist organizations were present, including the People’s Power Assembly, Ujima People’s Progress Party, Baltimore for Border Justice and the Maryland chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. Demonstrators marched from North Dallas Court to North Broadway, right in front of the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Building on the medical campus. Several Hopkins students participated in the protest. Sebastian Link, a Sociology graduate student who participated in the sit-in at Garland Hall, questioned the University’s policies in an interview with The News-Letter. The month-long occupation of Garland in protest of the planned private police force ended on May 8 with the arrests of seven people, including

 “Justice 4 Floyd”: Hopkins sign graffitied and covered up - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

The marble sign on the Merrick Gateway and parts of the Mattin Center were spray-painted with messages such as “Justice 4 Floyd” and “No JHUPD” following nationwide protests against police brutality on May 31. The University has since covered the sign with tarp, surrounded it with fences and is in the process of removing the messages. Ignited by the killing of 46-year-old George Floyd by a white police officer in the Minneapolis Police Department, these protests have spotlighted the Black Lives Matter movement and systemic racial injustice in the U.S. Although many protests have been peaceful, there have been multiple instances of vandalism, looting and arson in major cities. Rising sophomore Cionne Gates expressed her support for the messages left on the sign in an email to The News-Letter. She emphasized the fact that — despite awareness of racialized police brutality — Hopkins still intends to pursue a private police

About 100 protesters marched to University President Ronald J. Daniels’ home on June 29, taping copies of a petition demanding the cancellation of the private police force to his front door and windows. The rally was organized and endorsed by numerous student and community groups, including Teachers and Researchers United (TRU), an unofficial graduate student union; Baltimore Bloc, a grassroots collective that aims to rebuild communities; and the Garland Sit-In and Occupation (Sit-In). First gathering at the Harriet Tubman Grove, demonstrators called on Hopkins to cut its ties with the Baltimore Police Department and to better invest in surrounding Black communities. The rally was held in solidarity with Black Lives Matter and nationwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice. Mihir Chaudhary, who graduated from the Bloomberg School of Public Health in May, was part of the coalition that helped plan the event. In an interview with The News-Letter, he

University President Ronald J. Daniels and other administrators announced the suspension of the implementation of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) for at least two years in an email on June 12. This announcement followed nationwide protests against racism and police brutality prompted by the killing of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police Department. While rising senior Smitha Mahesh was surprised that University leaders responded to student outcry, she was dissatisfied that they did not take the decision further. “All these petitions, protests, and outcry from students, faculty, the Hopkins community and the whole of Baltimore City community have been very clear that there should be a complete abolishment of the private police force,” she said. “ I ask the question — why wait? Why pause? We should completely abolish the private police right now.” In April 2019, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan signed the Community Safety and

The Judiciary Committee of the Maryland House of Delegates held a session on Feb. 23 to discuss House Bill 336 (HB0336) and House Bill 1284 (HB1284). Both bills, if passed, will repeal past laws related to the establishment and maintenance of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD). HB0336 would also prohibit all private universities in Maryland from establishing their own police forces. Following nationwide protests last summer after the death of George Floyd, University President Ronald J. Daniels announced that all plans related to the JHPD would be halted for at least two years. In late August, the University also paused the Police Accountability Board, tasked with overseeing the formation of the JHPD. At the session, Delegate Julian Ivey, sponsor of HB0336, underscored the importance of addressing nationwide calls for police reform. “We must take the necessary steps to restore the public’s trust with the already established police departments we

Community partners can now submit proposals to the JHU Innovation Fund for Community Safety through the fund's website until 5 p.m. on Feb. 25. University President Ronald J. Daniels launched the four-year, $6 million initiative last September to engage the community in creating public safety efforts that do not involve policing. Projects in Mount Vernon, Charles Village and East Baltimore will be prioritized. In an email to the student body sent on Jan. 14, Bloomberg School of Public Health Dean Ellen J. MacKenzie, Vice Dean of Public Health Practice and Community Engagement Josh Sharfstein and Vice President of Economic Development Alicia Wilson affirmed the University’s commitment to decreasing crime in Baltimore. “The University has long supported community-based approaches to public safety, and we believe that this moment calls upon all of us who care deeply about Baltimore and its citizens to imagine alternatives for reducing violence that don’t rely on

The University announced the creation of the Innovation Fund for Community Safety on Sept. 30. This four-year, six-million-dollar fund will support community-based public safety programs and alternatives to policing in Baltimore. Vice President for Economic Development Alicia Wilson, one of the University leaders overseeing this fund, stated in an interview with The News-Letter that the fund will be open to any program, whether new or established, wishing to throw its hat into the ring. “The main goals of this fund are really to let community organizations, students and faculty have the ability to innovate around how to address community safety and community wellness,” she said. “Many times organizations and groups know how to solve the problems that are present in their community, but they usually are not given the space... and resources to do so.” Wilson stressed that the University wants to support initiatives that are community-led, regardless of whether

The Judicial Proceedings Committee of the Maryland General Assembly held a hearing for Senate Bill 276, sponsored by Senator Jill P. Carter on Jan. 21. The bill, if passed, would repeal laws that approved the establishment and maintenance of a private police department at Hopkins. The bill was introduced at the beginning of the Maryland General Assembly on Jan. 13. The state legislature passed the Community Safety and Strengthening Act in April 2019, authorizing the University to have its own police force. Governor Larry Hogan promptly signed it into law. In response, Hopkins students launched a month-long sit-in at Garland Hall in protest, resulting in arrests of four students after the Baltimore police and fire departments were called to evict the protestors. Over 100 professors have since spoken out in opposition to the creation of the police force. Last June, University President Ronald J. Daniels announced that plans for the

The Maryland General Assembly gave a bill that would allow the University to create its own private police force their final approval on Monday. Following this, University President Ronald J. Daniels and Dean of Medical Faculty Paul B. Rothman released a statement commenting on the passage of Senate Bill (SB) 793, titled the Community Safety and Strengthening Act. The Maryland House of Delegates voted 94-42 in favor of the bill, while the Senate voted 42-2 in favor. In their statement, Daniels and Rothman explain that if the bill is signed into law, it will go into effect on July 1. They added that University administrators will start negotiating a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Baltimore Police Department (BPD), as well as soliciting community input. After negotiating the MOU, the University could begin recruiting and training officers by late 2019 or early 2020. Daniels and Rothman thanked both supporters and

In response to the University’s efforts to implement the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD), over 100 Hopkins faculty members signed a letter addressed to the Board of Trustees. The letter, which was sent on Jan. 13, detailed six major concerns shared by the signatories, highlighting the negative impacts a private police force could have on the greater city of Baltimore. The letter states that the signatories continue to oppose a private police force and believe that instead, the University should dedicate its resources to addressing the root cause of crime. Some solutions faculty members endorsed are mental health resources, youth-oriented education programs and offering public health services for drug addiction, citing experts from both the University itself and active community members. “Johns Hopkins can do far more to repair its reputation and enhance the safety and wellbeing of our Institutions and the residents of Baltimore by focusing on what it

University officials have submitted their list of 13 nominees for the Johns Hopkins University Police Accountability Board to the Maryland Senate. If confirmed, these nominees will be responsible for assessing the policies of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD), presenting community feedback and ensuring transparency. An eight-member nominating committee whittled down the original pool of 121 applicants and presented University leadership with 40 recommendations, which the administration then used to select their nominees. Members of the accountability board will serve two-year terms, with the exception of the student representatives, who will serve one-year terms. Student nominee Shanice Guthrie, a junior in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences (KSAS), told The News-Letter that she believed the University had chosen a group of nominees that represented a diverse array of experiences and priorities. “We come from different backgrounds with different beliefs toward Baltimore and Baltimore police.

In a letter to the Johns Hopkins University Police Accountability Board on August 26, the University revealed that the board would be paused until further notice. The Accountability Board was originally created in February to monitor the creation of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) and collect community input. In June, the University announced that the JHPD’s implementation would be suspended for at least two years following nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. Karen Lancaster, assistant vice president of external relations for the Office of Communications, explained in an email to The News-Letter that the University thought it made the most sense to pause the JHPD and the Accountability Board simultaneously. “Because the Accountability Board’s statutory role is to directly shape the development and operation of the future Johns Hopkins Police Department, we have determined that continuing that work now would contradict our commitment to a complete pause in

The Coalition Against Policing by Hopkins (CAPH), consisting of about a dozen student and community groups, marched in East Baltimore on August 15 to demand the termination of the University’s plans to implement a private police force. Speakers criticized the University’s historical mistreatment of surrounding communities of color — from the harvesting of Henrietta Lacks’ cancer cells to the East Baltimore Development Initiative, which displaced over 700 families near the medical campus. CAPH member Mihir Chaudhary, who graduated from the Bloomberg School of Public Health in May, argued in an interview with The News-Letter that the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) would exacerbate racial inequity in Baltimore. “The police is the crown of this process of gentrification. It does not exist in isolation,” he said. “It exists as a multipronged approach of racialized exclusion that Hopkins has been engaging in for years.” Karen Lancaster, assistant vice president of external relations

On August 25, I tendered my resignation from the Johns Hopkins Police Accountability Board (JHPAB). A day later, University officials sent a letter to the remaining Board members informing them that their tenure had been “paused” in keeping with University President Ronald J. Daniels’ June announcement regarding a similar “pause” to the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD). I resigned from the JHPAB for two reasons. First, my personal reasons for joining the Board had not been met or fulfilled. Second, in the nearly seven months since this Board was convened, we had failed to execute — in any way — our primary duty of engaging and enabling community members to share community concerns regarding the JHPD. When I submitted my nomination to be part of the JHPAB, I did so for several reasons. As a Black father of two young sons, I was concerned about potential racial profiling and police

In an interview with The News-Letter on Wednesday, University President Ronald J. Daniels discussed progress on the University’s Roadmap on Diversity and Inclusion, the future of the private police force, plans for the spring and safety measures being implemented in anticipation of resuming in-person activities. Progress on diversity and inclusion The Roadmap to Diversity and Inclusion was drafted in early 2016 in response to demands from the Black Student Union following Freddie Gray’s death at the hands of Baltimore police. Last July the University announced the formation of its 2020 Task Force to review the 2016 Roadmap and develop goals for the next five years to find areas in need of improvement. During the interview, Daniels emphasized that increasing the recruitment of underrepresented minorities was a priority of the 2020 Task Force. He stated that the University has seen a steady trend of increasing diversity among faculty and staff. According

“We realize that 2015 has defined American policing and its future in a very different way,” Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said at a recent Foreign Affairs Symposium (FAS) panel on policing on March 22. Tuesday marked one year since the arrest of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man and Baltimore native. His death one week later from a severe spinal cord injury sparked more than a week of both peaceful and violent protesting that gained national attention. The issue of police misconduct, which has been under increased scrutiny since the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. in 2014, came to a head in Baltimore last April. “We’re the nation’s eighth largest police department,” Davis said, “and for far too many years, our agency, like other agencies that struggle with violence, really turned into a one-dimensional police department where the only thing that mattered was reducing violence.” The FAS

The University released a dashboard on Monday to track coronavirus (COVID-19) cases confirmed through the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Call Center (JHCCC) and regular testing of students living on campus. Contact tracing is not part of the website. In addition, the University is launching an epidemiological surveillance study that will test volunteered participants regularly to better monitor the spread of the COVID-19 on the Homewood Campus. University affiliates can apply to be part of the study by Sept. 30. Testing data from the study will also be included in the dashboard. The University previously announced plans for a COVID-19 dashboard and the epidemiological study on August 25. The dashboard was supposed to be released by August 31, the first day of the fall semester. Similar online portals at peer institutions, such as the University of Notre Dame, have been live since August. Sophomore Tangya Tan believes that the dashboard should have

You may have been surprised to see the University’s announcement regarding spring 2021 earlier this month. You were more than likely happy about it, but you were definitely still surprised. Something seemed a bit off. On the same day that Vice Provost for Student Affairs Alanna Shanahan and Executive Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Stephen Gange sent an email to Hopkins undergraduates titled “Welcoming you to campus this spring,” the U.S. reported its highest seven-day average of COVID-19 cases yet. Just a few days earlier, Dr. Anthony Fauci told The Washington Post, “All the stars are aligned in the wrong place... You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.” This contrast should be treated as a flashing red warning sign. Last summer the University sent out a similar email regarding fall 2020 planning, telling students to expect a hybrid semester. A few months later, mere weeks before classes began, the

Eight days before classes even started, the University announced that a small cluster of off-campus students in Baltimore had tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). In the same email, administrators urged students to stay at home, as they did in their delayed decision to switch from hybrid learning to online-only. It was unrealistic for administrators to expect all students to remain at home. We are stuck in leases that the University encouraged us to sign. Students had to decide whether it was safer to return to campus rather than live with at-risk family members. International students had to choose between moving back to Baltimore and facing unreasonable time zone differences. However, Hopkins made an exception for students who have a demonstrated hardship due to their situation at home or educational needs. These students are now being housed on-campus. We applaud Hopkins for acknowledging that staying home is not a realistic option

Nine Hopkins professors have signed an open letter calling for President Donald Trump’s removal from office after his actions encouraged far-right rioters to storm the Capitol building on Wednesday, Jan 6. As of publication, the open letter has been signed by over 1300 political scientists, including Hopkins professors Filipe Campante, Hahrie Han, Dan Honig, Margaret E. Keck, Renée Marlin-Bennett, Adam Seth Levine, Olga Oliker, Sarah E. Parkinson and Adam Sheingate. The letter urges lawmakers to either impeach Trump or invoke the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. “The President’s actions threaten American democracy,” the letter reads. “Our profession seeks to understand politics, not engage in it, but we share a commitment to democratic values. The President’s actions show he is unwilling or unable to fulfill his oath to protect and defend the Constitution. He should be removed from office immediately before further violence takes place or further damage is

Vice President for Public Safety Dr. Branville Bard Jr. sent an email to the Hopkins community containing updates on the implementation of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) on August 23. The email explained that over the past year, the University has devoted time to strengthening the University’s public safety organization. This includes improving operations through existing security officers and implementing crisis intervention, gender identity awareness and trauma-informed training. The office has also implemented the new Behavioral Health Crisis Support Team, a nontraditional approach to reducing violence that pairs public safety officers with clinicians to support community members experiencing personal crises. Bard also explained how the University's Innovation Fund for Community Safety recently celebrated its first year of completion. The initiative aims to support community-led initiatives in Baltimore to address housing insecurity, job training, education, community organizing and more. The email provided updates on the implementation of the JHPD since

One year after pausing efforts to create the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD), the University announced the nine winners of its $6 million Innovation Fund for Community Safety. According to the University, the purpose of the fund is to bolster community initiatives aimed at reducing violent crime. These programs will take place near University campuses in Mount Vernon, Charles Village and East Baltimore. Despite these investments in non-policing alternatives to public safety, Vice President for Communications Andrew Green wrote in an email to The News-Letter that the University plans to move forward with the creation of the JHPD. In an interview with The News-Letter, Alicia Wilson, vice president for economic development for the University and its health system, explained that the goal of the initiative was to involve the community in tackling safety issues on and near campus and to deliver community-focused solutions.

Hopkins announced the creation of the Johns Hopkins University Behavioral Health Crisis Support Team (JHU BHCST) to respond to behavioral and mental health crises on and around Homewood Campus on May 18. In an email to constituents, University President Ronald J. Daniels, Acting Vice President for Public Safety Connor Scott and Vice Provost for Student Health and Well-Being Kevin Shollenberger promoted the initiative as part of the University’s commitment to reimagining public safety. They noted that currently, campus safety and security officers are the first and sole in-person responders to behavioral health crises. In an interview with The News-Letter, Scott clarified that the team will pair behavioral health clinicians with Crisis-Intervention-Trained (CIT) security officers during shifts seven days a week. The team will be dispatched by the Counseling Center or Security Office, which receive the calls, and the clinician will take the lead in the response. Shollenberger stated that the

Earlier this semester, the University announced the official launch of the Behavioral Health Crisis Support Team (BHCST). In an email to the student body on Nov. 9, administration stated that the initiative will begin with a pilot program on Homewood Campus and gradually expand to the entirety of the University. As of Dec. 10, the team has responded to four distress calls for students and one distress call for a community member, according to Vice Provost for Student Health and Well-Being Kevin Shollenberger and Director of Media Relations Jill Rosen. Jarron Jackson, senior director of the Office of Campus Safety and Security (Campus Security), explained why his security team views the BHCST as a crucial element for Campus Security’s response to people in crises in an interview with The News-Letter. “21st-century public safety is really about problem solving,” he said. “I think that need is best fit by a dual

The University held a town hall meeting on Sept. 22 in Shriver Hall to hear community feedback on an initial draft of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The event was disrupted by protesters, forcing the school to move the town hall online. In 2020, the University announced a two-year pause on the implementation of the JHPD following student protests. At the beginning of the fall semester of 2022, the University announced intentions to resume the development of a private police force. In an interview with The News-Letter, Vice President for Public Safety Dr. Branville Bard Jr. explained that establishing a private police force is necessary to keep campus safe. “The prevailing model at colleges and universities is to provide policing services as part of a comprehensive public safety strategy,” he said. “It’s not anything new.

For over a week, members of the Hopkins and Baltimore community have participated in a sit-in at Garland Hall to protest the proposed private police force and the University’s contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The protest is organized by Students Against Private Police (SAPP) and the Hopkins Coalition Against ICE. Members of these groups attempted to deliver a letter to University President Ronald J. Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar at their offices on Wednesday, April 10. The letter asks to open negotiations between protestors and members of the administration. As Daniels and Kumar were not available at the time, the protesters gave Dean of Student Life Smita Ruzicka the letter. Sophomore Jeremy Berger, who has been participating in the sit-in, explained that it was important that the letter be delivered in person. The letter stated that protesters had requested a meeting over email with Daniels and Kumar on

The University broadcasted its second virtual town hall on Sept. 29 at the School of Medicine’s campus in East Baltimore and its third fully virtual town hall on Sept. 30. The town halls were intended to garner community feedback on the draft of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Students and community members opposed to the JHPD interrupted proceedings at the town hall on Sept. 29. This followed the first town hall on Sept. 22, held at the Homewood campus, which was moved online after protestors staged a “Die-In“ at the in-person event. In an interview with The News-Letter, Vice President for Public Safety Branville Bard Jr. asserted that students and community members should accept the need for policing. “Policing is always going to be a necessary component of public safety,“ he said. “I would ask that everyone take up our collective energies and focus on

The JHU Dissenters and Refuel Our Future co-hosted a teach-in at Keyser Quad on Nov. 9 to educate attendees about the University’s involvement in war and climate change. Hopkins students gave speeches about issues related to the Applied Physics Lab (APL), the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD), fossil fuel investments, the University’s collaboration with the Space Force and Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC). The teach-in began with postdoctoral fellow Heidi Nicholls defining militarism. “Militarism is the perpetual state of war that we live in: how our lives are structured by war and war-making processes,” she said. “[JHU Dissenters] believe we already have everything we need to be safe. If we directed all these resources that Hopkins is pouring into militarism… to serve communities… then we could be living collectively a lot longer [and] better.” Nicholls pointed out that the U.S. is the number one global military spender. She added that

The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) released a report earlier this month titled “Schools of Mass Destruction: American Universities in the U.S. Nuclear Weapons Complex.” The report identifies Hopkins as one of the universities involved in the development and maintenance of nuclear weapons in the U.S. ICAN is a consortium of non-governmental organizations across the globe that seek to ban the existence of nuclear weapons. The coalition was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017 for its work in promoting the United Nations nuclear weapons ban treaty. The main channel for the University’s involvement in defense research is the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), which holds contracts with many U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DOD) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Should the Hopkins APL continue nuclear weapons research? Nuclear weapons experts and students alike disagreed over the role that universities like Hopkins should

Hopkins affiliates and community members engaged in a series of events to protest against the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) on Nov. 29. The event started with a walk-out at 12:30 p.m., followed by a protest march from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. and ended with a vigil at 5 p.m at the Homewood Museum. The march took place around the Homewood campus, starting at Gilman Hall and ending at the Beach, with checkpoints at Homewood Field and Wyman Park. Attendees were also encouraged to join West Wednesday, a weekly demonstration fighting for accountability for Tyrone West and all victims of police brutality, at 6:30 p.m. at City Hall. During the walk-out, senior Jayla Scott shared some of their concerns regarding the impacts of the JHPD on the surrounding community. “When you police Hopkins students and staff for their safety, you’re also policing community members. You are policing marginalized communities...

Tawanda Jones, sister of Tyrone West, who died in police custody in 2013, hosted the 300th West Wednesday rally and march on Wednesday. For the past four weeks of the sit-in at Garland Hall, student protesters have joined Jones for West Wednesday rallies, and recently the sit-in participants renamed a room in Garland after Tyrone West. The rally began at the corner of Greenmount Avenue and 33rd Street. It kicked off with a speech from Jones. Members of the Coalition of Concerned Mothers and Families United 4 Justice also spoke. Jones read a poem that she wrote after West’s death. A member of Women Against Private Police urged participants to sign a petition that may help stop the private police force that would otherwise take effect in June. Afterward the protesters marched through the streets for an hour and ended at Garland Hall. The West Coalition, which came together after

In light of recent developments with the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD), the Abell Improvement Association (AIA), the neighborhood improvement association for the Abell community in Charles Village, reflected on the effect of the JHPD on neighboring communities. The AIA voted in opposition to the JHPD in April 2019. Maureen Daly, the former president of AIA, discussed the organization’s decision making processes in an interview with The News-Letter. “There was a great deal of discussion at that meeting, and many different positions were presented,” she said. “When the University proposed [the plan for an armed police force], they expressed a perception that Baltimore is dangerous and that an armed police force would address that problem, but there was a strong feeling in the community that an armed private police force would not address community problems but might lead to greater violence and bigger problems.” Daly further emphasized that many surrounding

Last week, Senator Antonio Hayes introduced a new bill in the Maryland General Assembly: the Community Safety and Strengthening Act. This bill, SB 793, and its correspondent in the Maryland House of Representatives, HB 1094, includes the University’s second bid for a private police force. At first glance, this bill may seem promising; It proposes funding programs like the Children and Youth Fund, Mayor Catherine Pugh’s YouthWorks summer job programs and the Police Athletics League. These programs provide valuable opportunities for employment and career tracks in law enforcement for young people in our city. Powerful voices have spoken out in favor of the bill, including alumnus and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Maryland Senate President Mike Miller, U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings and Mayor Catherine Pugh. However, we at The News-Letter believe it is equally important to listen to those who oppose a Hopkins police force: particularly the voices of

On Monday, March 5 the University announced its intent to create a private police force. In the following week and a half, students created a petition against the proposal that has since garnered thousands of signatures; protested in front of University President Ronald J. Daniels’ home for the first time in recent memory; led phone banking efforts to voice their discontent to Maryland legislators; and expressed their concerns at forums both at Homewood and at the Medical Campus. These events reflect the shock and confusion felt by the student body and the greater Baltimore community. Even Baltimore City Council members were surprised by the University’s announcement, and on Monday evening, the Council adopted a resolution which would require that Hopkins consult them in creating a private police force. At an SGA forum on Tuesday night, administrators dodged questions about to what extent they informed local neighborhood associations about the University’s

The University’s plans for the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) have sparked discourse among members of the Hopkins community — including faculty members. Following the recent developments with the JHPD, The News-Letter interviewed University faculty to discuss their views on the JHPD’s impacts on the Hopkins community. As the University continues forward with the implementation of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD), many faculty, students and community members have spoken about the armed private police force. In an interview with The News-Letter, Peter Armitage, physics and astronomy professor, shared his beliefs on the best plan for the University. “[JHPD is] not good for faculty, students, staff, the University and Baltimore, and that's the considered opinion of the faculty Senate on this matter,” he said. “The best path forward would be to abandon it.” Similar to Armitage, Professor Emeritus Toby Ditz emphasized that the University should renounce its plan to create

On Monday, the Homewood Faculty Assembly (HFA) voted in favor of requesting the University to terminate its initiative to implement a private police force and requesting amnesty for those involved in protesting this initiative. Following the passage of the vote, the HFA sent a written resolution to the University concerning its requests on Tuesday. Composed of current full-time faculty and faculty emeriti in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and the Whiting School of Engineering, HFA is a forum in which faculty meet twice a year to discuss University issues and propose recommendations to the administration through formal written resolutions. These formal resolutions are then sent to the Homewood Academic Council, which includes University President Ronald J. Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar. For several faculty, the HFA’s vote and formal resolution come after what they feel has been a consistent lack of transparency from the University. According to Kristin

Vice President for Public Safety Branville Bard sent an email to the Hopkins community on Dec. 2 announcing the final draft of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) and the University for the implementation of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD). In the email, Bard stressed the importance of community involvement in amending the proposed MOU. “[There were] 60 days for public and City Council review and comment, three Hopkins-sponsored town halls, nearly 30 individual and small group meetings, a town hall hosted by two City Council members, and well over 250 comments and questions submitted,” he wrote. Along with the final draft of the MOU, Bard sent a report summarizing the engagement process and feedback on the MOU from 21CP Solutions, as well as a disposition report that lists the feedback submitted.

More than 200 students and demonstrators surrounded Homewood House (now known as Homewood Museum) in protest of military recruiting on campus on April 17, 1970. The protest occurred following the events on April 16, where 40 activists blocked the entrance to Levering Hall to protest the U.S. Marine Corps recruiters inside. University President Lincoln Gordon addressed protesters twice that day: once to promise a referendum and once to warn against a takeover. A court injunction limiting protest was issued on the same day, banning any meetings or speeches that would interfere with the normal operations of the University. Following the injunction, demonstrators began a weekend-long vigil near the library. Gordon promised to revoke the injunction if protesters agreed to his proposed referendum. Students rejected Gordon’s proposal on three grounds, according to an article published in an April 20, 1970 edition of The News-Letter. “1. one cannot determine the rightness or

Teachers and Researchers United (TRU-UE) hosted a discussion panel entitled “Building Safe Communities without JHPD” on March 29. The event featured four panelists, comprised of both doctoral students and community members. Stephanie Saxton, a Political Science doctoral student at Hopkins, was the first speaker. To contextualize the claims and actions currently taken against the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD), Saxton provided a timeline of its development. In March 2018, Hopkins first announced the bill that would authorize the establishment of a University police force. According to Saxton, student organizers convened to discuss the announcement, which led to the creation of Students Against Private Police (SAPP). SAPP’s initial campaign targeted elected officials through lobbying, door-knocking, base-building and petitions, which successfully prevented the bill from passing legislation at the time. “This is an important part of the history.

 How has Hopkins contributed to and perpetuated redlining in Baltimore? - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Over the course of the past year, researchers have found that residents of low-income, majority-Black neighborhoods in Baltimore and cities across the country are at a higher risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19. For these neighborhoods in Baltimore, a common pattern emerges: They were almost all subjected to mid-20th century practices of housing segregation, including redlining and other racist policies. The history of redlining In the 1930s, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) instituted redlining, which denied investment in neighborhoods deemed high risk. The risk was generally based on race or ethnicity. Members of minority groups were unable to secure housing loans outside of specially designated neighborhoods, whereas wealthier, white residents moved elsewhere. Although racial discrimination in housing was banned in 1968, the impacts of these practices remain. The correlation between redlined neighborhoods and COVID-19 risk factors is merely one example of how these policies fueled pervasive inequities. The

A group of community activists and Hopkins students marched along York Road on July 11 to highlight racial disparities in North Baltimore. Demonstrators first gathered at the corner of York Road and Cold Spring Lane — a symbolic intersection, according to social worker Zachery Dingle, who ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for Maryland’s fourth congressional district. In an interview with The News-Letter, Dingle stated that he has observed inequity in Baltimore throughout his lifetime. “There is a clear disparity between the east and west sides of York Road. It was like this when I was a child, and it’s still like this today, he said. “This is typical of America — the haves versus the have-nots. At this time, we need to make an announcement that the have-nots have had enough.” The group marched from the crossroad to the Belvedere Square Market, where Heber Brown III, the senior pastor

Last spring, Hopkins Hospital paused its long-time practice of suing patients who could not afford their medical treatments. Activists have fought against the University’s aggressive medical debt collection tactics for years. As recently as last month, End Medical Debt Maryland hosted a rally to advocate for the Medical Debt Protection Act, which passed in this year’s Maryland General Assembly. The rally distributed information from ACLU of Maryland’s Know Your Rights program, detailing services and resources for individuals targeted by the Hospital. Because the University is a tax-exempt nonprofit, it is required by law to provide community benefits, such as offering medical services to those who demonstrate need for free or at a reduced cost. However, as highlighted in a 2019 report by National Nurses United (NNU) and the Coalition for a Humane Hopkins, many defendants were never informed about these resources. The report, titled “Taking Neighbors to Court: Johns Hopkins

Nurses from the Hopkins Hospital and National Nurses United (NNU), a union of registered nurses, joined local politicians and community members for a town hall event on Saturday at the Reginald F. Lewis Museum. Nurses from the Hospital gave a presentation called “Reputation vs. Reality,” arguing that the institution does not live up to its worldwide reputation. During the presentation, NNU revealed three investigative reports, which alleged that the Hospital was creating an unsafe environment for patients and nurses. The report highlighted understaffing of nurses, insufficient safety equipment and mandatory overtime as major issues. Nurses at the Hospital have been trying to unionize since early June. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) recently reported that the Hospital has violated federal law by enacting anti-union regulations, including banning nurses from communicating with workers in other units and coming in to work on their days off. The nurses, in conjunction with NNU,

The U.S. government classifies most colleges and universities as nonprofits because of their “educational purposes,” exempting them from federal income taxes. This means that, despite operating four campuses in Baltimore, Hopkins is not legally required to pay the city any property taxes. In 2016, Baltimore City entered into a 10-year Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) agreement with “anchor institutions,” whereby these institutions were required to pay the city a collective $60 million over the course of 10 years. The University, the Bayview Medical Center and Hopkins Hospital were all represented in this deal, with the University alone paying $1.8 million annually. However, in 2019, many Maryland-based organizations called for PILOT to be renegotiated, arguing that it is only a fraction of what Hopkins would be paying if it were a for-profit institution. In 2019, the University would have paid $26.6 million in property taxes if not for its exempt

End Medical Debt Maryland held a rally at the Hopkins Hospital Billings building on April 3 to protest against the practice of suing patients over medical debt. End Medical Debt Maryland is a coalition of 58 organizations that are advocating for the Medical Debt Protection Act to be passed at the Maryland General Assembly this spring. Numerous Baltimore residents shared their stories of financial and emotional distress incurred from the hardships of medical debt. The protesters also distributed “Know Your Rights” flyers around the neighborhood. Brig Dumais, coalition chair of End Medical Debt Maryland, emphasized that residents of East Baltimore are most likely to be sued for medical debt, notably Black people, single mothers and low-income essential workers. According to Dumais, at least 17% of Marylanders currently have medical debt in collections, with the median debt totaled around $944. “Ending medical debt is not only a patients’ rights issue. It’s

The Coalition for a Humane Hopkins (CAHH), which aims to hold Hopkins accountable to the communities it has harmed, held a protest on Sept. 15 against the University’s practice of suing patients over alleged medical debt. About 20 Hopkins affiliates and community members drove or biked through campus in protest. The caravan ended in Harriet Tubman Grove, where speakers criticized the University’s actions and praised community activism. Mihir Chaudhary, a physician at a Hopkins field hospital, criticized the School of Medicine for not living up to its mission statement, which includes improving health in both the community and the world. “We’re focusing for a second on one arm of Hopkins’ strategy of structural displacement and oppression: medical litigation,” Chaudhary said. Hopkins Hospital has used hardball tactics to sue thousands of its Black and low-income neighbors in East Baltimore — for a median amount of $1,089 in alleged medical debt, according

Hopkins Teachers and Researchers United (TRU) and the Coalition for a Humane Hopkins (CAHH) co-hosted a discussion about Hopkins Hospital’s debt collection practices against low-income patients at Red Emma’s Bookstore on Wednesday. The event was endorsed by Hopkins Nurses United, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), JHU Sit-In, Hopkins Coalition Against Ice, Refuel Our Future, Latino/a Medical Student Association, Black Student Union, Asian Pacific American Medical Student Association, Incarceration and Health Justice Collective, Student National Medical Association, and First Generation Low Income Partnership in Medicine (FLIP-MD). The panelists included Ed Keyser, an AFL-CIO researcher; Dr. Zack Berger, an physician and associate professor at the School of Medicine; Steph Saxton, a PhD candidate at Hopkins and a member of Students Against Private Police; Derek Jannarone, a registered nurse at the Hospital; Rachel Strodel, a first-year student at the School of Medicine; and Joel Pally, a member

The pain and the horror of the whole process, of being relocated and displaced, of gentrified community — you can’t imagine the pain that goes through your mind.” These are the words of Donald Gresham, who is president of the Baltimore Redevelopment Action Coalition for Empowerment (BRACE), a nonprofit that aims to promote economic and racial equity in the city, particularly for the former and remaining residents of the Middle East neighborhood. Located near Hopkins Hospital, Middle East has been renamed Eager Park as part of East Baltimore Development Inc. (EBDI), the most drastic urban redevelopment initiative in recent American history, displacing about 800 predominantly Black and Brown families.

In the wake of the recent closure of the Save Middle East Action Committee (SMEAC), some residents in the Middle East Baltimore area that the organization served are embittered. But despite SMEAC's internal conflicts and its resulting disbandment, members of the community hope that a new organization can serve their interests. According to Donald Gresham, the former president of SMEAC, the organization closed because the "community's need has changed." SMEAC was created eight years ago to protect the interests and provide a voice for residents in Middle East Baltimore, the area affected by the redevelopment around the Hopkins Medical Institute. The organization often had a tense relationship with the East Baltimore Development Initiative (EBDI), the nonprofit partnership of parties invested in the project. University President Ronald Daniels serves on the EBDI board. While he did not directly address why the organization was disbanded, Gresham felt that "because of the limitations

Last Wednesday, Teachers and Researchers United (TRU-UE) held a discussion panel on potential alternatives to the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD). While this event was organized by the Hopkins graduate student union, faculty members also participated and expressed support for increased community dialogue surrounding the JHPD. If there’s one issue that has seemed to drive undergraduates, graduate students and faculty alike to use their voices, it’s the JHPD. In 2019, students and community members held a month-long sit-in in Garland Hall to protest the planned private police force and the University’s contracts with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Protesters even refused to leave Garland Hall after 80 Baltimore police officers arrived to vacate the building. Four students — two undergraduate and two graduate — were arrested. This past fall, the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Faculty Senate unanimously passed a resolution expressing its opposition to the JHPD, echoing many of

More than 600 faculty members signed a petition delivered to University President Ronald J. Daniels on June 5 calling for greater representation in University decision-making. The petition also demanded more financial transparency and the reversal of various austerity measures taken by the University, including hiring freezes and suspension of retirement plan contributions. The petition stemmed in part from History Professor François Furstenberg’s article “University Leaders Are Failing,” which was published in The Chronicle of Higher Education three weeks ago. Furstenberg argued that Hopkins administrators lead the University as a multinational corporation instead of an academic institution. By doing so, he wrote, administrators were unable to financially prepare for the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak and failed to fulfill the core academic mission of the University. In an interview with The News-Letter, Furstenberg described the current administrative organization at Hopkins as unsustainable. “We have a real lack of robust faculty

Refuel Our Future, the University’s student-run divestment organization, is starting Fossil Free Fridays, a weekly strike on Fridays going off of the national Fridays For Future (FFF) climate strike movement. Instead of protesting for climate justice and a Green New Deal, which is the basis of the fight for the youth FFF movement, Refuel will protest for fossil fuel divestment, a fight that the organization has been trying to win for a few years. Students want divestment from fossil fuels. Divestment means that Hopkins will no longer depend on fossil fuels in any way and will no longer invest in those companies as part of their endowment. The University’s endowment, which is worth $4.33 billion, allows the University to give scholarships and financial aid to their students. If it is steadily growing, it can help reduce annual tuition, which many people depend on in order to attend the University. Hopkins

For years, the task of managing the tenure process at Hopkins has been the responsibility of each individual campus. However, on Jan. 10, the Board of Trustees unanimously endorsed the proposal to create a Tenure Advisory Committee (TAC) to oversee tenure cases across all tenure-granting schools within the university. Promising job stability, academic recognition and a consistent salary, tenure originally became popular at universities in the U.S. during the 1940s. In an interview with The News-Letter, Professor Derek Schilling, member of the Executive Committee of the Johns Hopkins chapter of the American Association of University Professors, explained that today, tenure is regarded as protection for academic freedom, and by extension, freedom of speech. “The most important aspect of tenure is that it does ensure that the tenured scholar can pursue any number of questions — even controversial questions — without the fear of being sanctioned by the University administration,” Schilling

The Critical Diaspora Studies (CDS) initiative was created to diversify the undergraduate student experience at Hopkins through the creation of a new interdisciplinary academic space. The initiative hopes that it will connect existing centers of study at the University to build a major and minor. Students majoring in CDS would have the opportunity to focus in specific areas of study, such as Asian-American and Pacific Islander Studies, Indigenous Studies or Latinx/Latiné Studies. The CDS initiative and Critical Responses to Anti-Asian Violence (CRAAV) hosted a roundtable to discuss the importance of the creation of a CDS major and minor on April 21. The conversation was moderated by sophomore Kobi Khong, a member of the working group for the CDS initiative.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, Asian Americans have been subject to physical and verbal attacks. The recent rise in hate crimes has raised further alarm in Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) communities nationwide. On Tuesday, eight people, six of whom were Asian, were shot in spas near Atlanta. Following these shootings, University President Ronald J. Daniels released a statement on March 18 condemning violent acts of racism. This statement came after many members of the University’s APIDA community called for increased support from the administration. Co-President Georgie D’Sanson of the Filipino Students Association described the statement as insufficient. “It seems like the statement was aimed more toward people who aren’t part of the APIDA community, the way it’s worded,” she said. “It didn’t feel personal.” In his email, Daniels promised University support of its APIDA community. “We are committed to providing the support that will allow our Asian

Following a rise in xenophobia against Asian Americans at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a recent string of high-profile attacks in the past few months that raised greater awareness of violence against the Asian American community. Victims faced unprovoked punching, violent shoving and slashing with weapons. Many attacks — which targeted different members of Asian communities, including Chinese, Thai, Filipino and Vietnamese people — have been captured on surveillance camera and shared widely on social media. Some attacks have led to hate crime charges. The University reached out to leaders of Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) organizations and the Multicultural Leadership Council (MLC) on Feb. 17 acknowledging these violent acts and extending its support to the Asian American community at Hopkins.

In response to the ongoing war in Gaza, Anthropology Department Professor and Graduate Studies Director Clara Han and Anthropology Department Associate Professor and Chair Naveeda Khan wrote the “Open Letter from JHU Faculty in Solidarity with Gaza.” As of Friday, Nov. 3, 29 professors have signed the letter. In an interview with The News-Letter, Khan shared the reasons behind writing the letter. “This letter didn’t come out of a deliberative process where we talked to a lot of people and had a lot of forums. This just emerged out of a group of us feeling like we have to mark the moment,” she said. “We just felt that we couldn’t sit by and be quiet.” The letter condemns the violence inflicted on the Palestinian people by Israel, expresses solidarity with the Palestinian people and calls for an immediate ceasefire.

Johns Hopkins University Dissenters organized “Candlelight Vigil for a Free Palestine” on Oct. 23. Students gathered at the beach to mourn the Palestinian lives lost in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The current Israeli-Hamas war began on Oct. 7 when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel; in response, Israel declared war on Hamas. As of Oct. 24, authorities reported that there have been at least 1,400 deaths in Israel and over 5,000 in Gaza. An event organizer, using the pseudonym of Jolene, stated in an interview with The News-Letter that the event hopes to provide an opportunity for students to talk about their thoughts publicly. “People were really afraid and nervous to speak out, and I think it leaves us feeling isolated and powerless when, in fact, we have a tremendous amount of power when we come together and discuss this,” she said. “It was important for people to organize

Following last week’s vigil, Johns Hopkins University Dissenters and Speak Out Now organized a walkout on Monday, Oct. 30 in solidarity with Palestine. The walkout voiced demands to the University administration and included speeches from Hopkins community members. Dissenters presented four demands to the University administration. First, they called on the University to divest from weapons manufacturers, like Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. Then, they demanded the University to publicly call for an immediate ceasefire, an end to Israel’s siege on Gaza and an end to U.S. military aid to Israel. They also called for the University to publicly condemn Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism, as well as hold individuals accountable for racist actions. Lastly, they asked the University to provide dedicated mental health resources to Palestinians and all groups affected by the ongoing conflict.

Editor’s Note: This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available. The Coalition for Advocacy for Non-Tenure Track Faculty Equity (CANE) wrote a letter on Jan. 12 calling for the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (Bloomberg School) Office of the Dean to address the increasing salary inequity between tenure track (TT) and non-tenure track (NTT) faculty salaries. At the time of this article, 224 Bloomberg School faculty members have added their signatures. According to the letter, tenure and non-tenure track Bloomberg School faculty both received a letter in July 2023 informing them that they would receive a pay increase, with tenured faculty receiving higher pay than non-tenured faculty by 8%.

The administration sent a broadcast email to the student body announcing a draft of the University’s second strategic framework, Ten for One, on April 14. The framework outlines 10 goals that the University hopes to achieve by 2030. The goals focus on building an inclusive, University-wide community on-campus; promoting excellence in students, faculty and staff; continuing to lead in research endeavours with real world impacts; and contributing to neighboring Baltimore communities. Ten for One follows Ten by Twenty, the first University-wide strategic framework published in 2013. The new strategy retains the goals from the previous framework to build one University, individual excellence and commitment to our neighboring community. In an email to The News-Letter, President Ronald J. Daniels reflected on the goals of the strategic framework. "The Ten for One strategic framework was informed by frank and wide-ranging conversations with more than 1,200 people from every part of our One

 Hopkins reflects on the end of legacy admissions - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

On Jan. 18, University President Ronald J. Daniels announced in The Atlantic that the University has not considered legacy status as a factor in admissions since 2014. With this move, Hopkins joined the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, the University of California system and several other institutions of higher education that do not consider legacy affiliation when evaluating admissions applications. Vice Provost for Admissions and Financial Aid David Phillips explained in an interview with The News-Letter that ending the legacy admissions program was part of a broader initiative to diversify the incoming classes of the University. “We have a higher proportion of students who are the first in their family to attend college,” he said. “Across the board, we have more diverse classes now than we did 10 years ago.” Phillips explained that applicants are still asked for their parents’ alma maters for statistical purposes. Daniels explained in his piece that

 How is the University supporting FLI students? - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

“Unfortunately, I cannot say that during my time at Hopkins I have felt supported as a [First-Generation, Limited-Income (FLI)] student by the University as a whole. Over time, the University has started to recognize the struggles that FLI students face, but it has been a slow process to correct these issues.” These are the words of senior Felicia Petterway, student representative of the FLI Network. Launched during the summer of 2018, the Network is comprised of students, staff and faculty. Its purpose is to promote solidarity and belonging among students who are from low-income families or who are the first in their family to attend college. The Network will host National First-Generation College Student Day this Friday, Nov 8. Last November, class of 1964 alum and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg donated $1.8 billion to Hopkins, allowing the University to permanently conduct need-blind admissions for American students, meaning

The Second Commission on Undergraduate Education (CUE2) released its final report on Nov. 20. The report made a wide array of recommendations to improve the undergraduate experience at Hopkins, including replacing the distribution requirements to obtain a degree. CUE2 was formed in 2017 to promote interdisciplinary learning and mental health on campus. Co-chaired by Whiting School of Engineering (WSE) Dean Ed Schlesinger and former Krieger School of Arts and Sciences (KSAS) Dean Beverly Wendland, CUE2 is made up of 30 faculty, staff, administrators, undergraduates and alumni. Since its creation, CUE2 has released draft plans and held town halls to collect community input on its recommendations. In email to The News-Letter, Student Government Association Junior Class President Nathan Mudrak stated that CUE2 successfully took student voices into consideration. “My confidence in the report is especially gained by the comprehensive and thorough approach the commission took to garnering student feedback,” he wrote.

The Second Commission on Undergraduate Education (CUE2) released a set of recommendations intended to revitalize the undergraduate experience at Hopkins on Wednesday. President Ronald J. Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar convened CUE2 in April 2017 as part of the University’s “Ten by Twenty” plan. Co-chaired by Krieger School of Arts and Sciences (KSAS) Dean Beverly Wendland and Whiting School of Engineering (WSE) Dean Ed Schlesinger, CUE2 is comprised of 30 faculty, staff, administrators, undergraduates and alumni. The draft report recommends that the University implement several changes to the undergraduate curriculum in order to promote interdisciplinary learning and global citizenship among the student body. “This report… seeks to establish the guiding principles and goals for a re-envisioned Johns Hopkins undergraduate education, one true to the University’s mission, faithful to its enduring character, and responsive to changing social, political and economic forces,” the authors of the report wrote.

The Second Commission on Undergraduate Education (CUE2) released a set of recommendations last month, intended to revitalize the undergraduate experience and promote mental health on campus. Co-chaired by Krieger School of Arts and Sciences (KSAS) Dean Beverly Wendland and Whiting School of Engineering (WSE) Dean Ed Schlesinger, CUE2 is comprised of 30 faculty, staff, administrators, undergraduates and alumni. On Thursday Feb. 27, CUE2 held its first town hall discussion in Levering Hall with Hopkins community members in order to receive feedback on the draft report. CUE2, convened by President Ronald J. Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar in April 2017, recommended that the University implement changes to the undergraduate curriculum. These changes include a mandatory first-year seminar and the establishment of a “Hopkins semester” of intensive study. Facilitators Michael Falk, vice dean of undergraduate education at WSE, and Bertrand García-Moreno facilitated the event. García-Moreno explained the reasoning behind CUE2’s recommendations. “Through

 Christopher Celenza to return to Hopkins as the new KSAS dean - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Christopher Celenza has been designated as the next James B. Knapp Dean of the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences (KSAS). According to a University-wide email sent on Oct. 22 by University President Ronald J. Daniels, Celenza will begin his tenure on Jan. 4, 2021. After Beverly Wendland, the former KSAS dean, was named the next provost of the Washington University in St. Louis in January, Hopkins formed a 21-person search committee to find the next dean. During the search, the University appointed John Toscano, a Hopkins chemistry professor and the vice dean for natural sciences, as interim dean in July. Celenza has been serving as the dean of Georgetown College of Arts and Sciences at Georgetown University since 2017. He was previously a professor in the Department of Classics at Hopkins from 2005, serving as department chair from 2014 to 2016. He also had a brief stint as the

In an email sent to Krieger School of Arts and Sciences (KSAS) affiliates on Monday, Dean Beverly Wendland announced that John Toscano will serve as the interim dean of KSAS starting July 1. Toscano, who is currently a chemistry professor and the vice dean for natural sciences, will hold this position until Wendland’s official successor is appointed. In January, the University formed a 21-person search committee to find the next KSAS dean after Wendland accepted an offer from the Washington University in St. Louis to serve as provost. The committee is using a search firm, Isaacson Miller, to find a suitable pool of candidates. Junior Jaanvi Mahesh, who is the undergraduate representative on the search committee, noted that the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has added challenges but is not hampering the work of the committee. “Our first meeting was in the last week of March...

The University launched Realizing Our Promise: The Second JHU Roadmap on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion with a virtual kickoff event on March 11, bringing several speakers to discuss the goals and initiatives of the Roadmap. This Roadmap is the second stage of the University's mission to incorporate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) into the core framework of the institution. The second Roadmap was designed to address the strengths and shortcomings of the first Roadmap, launched in 2016, and the recommendations of the Roadmap 2020 Task Force. At the event, University President Ronald J. Daniels recalled the influence of the first Roadmap on the institution. “We have laid a critical foundation for public accountability and radical transparency through a regular report on staff, faculty and graduate student diversity numbers across our divisions,” he said. However, he also acknowledged the limitations of the first Roadmap and how there is still substantial work

University leaders held a virtual town hall on Sept. 18 to inform students about updates to the Roadmap on Diversity and Inclusion and the Roadmap 2020 Task Force. The Roadmap was originally published in the fall of 2016 with the intention of fostering greater diversity within the University’s faculty, students, staff, climate and greater community. At the town hall, Provost Sunil Kumar noted that the University has made significant strides toward diversity and inclusion since 2016, including ending legacy admissions and changing hiring processes. “We have seen real and measurable progress... but by no means should you mistake what I’m saying as a victory lap,” he said. “There’s still a lot more to be done, and structural change requires consistent, persistent and deliberate efforts from hundreds of people across the institution.” According to Kumar, under the Roadmap, faculty, undergraduate and graduate diversity have increased.

Daniels today at 1:45 p.m. They issued a list of demands to Daniels to increase the representation of black faculty, students and staff on campus, as well as addressing the lack of support for black students. Protesters gathered at 1:30 p.m. in the tunnel under Gilman, and then marched up the Breezeway between Remsen and Mergenthaler Halls, chanting: “It happens at Mizzou. It happens here, too.” They were referencing the recent events at the University of Missouri (Mizzou) where students have been protesting the state of black rights on campus. They demanded that the number of black students, faculty and administrators be increased to 10 percent of the total and that more diversity

Two months ago, University President Ronald J. Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar sent an email to the Hopkins community on July 8 detailing the creation of a 2020 Task Force to review the 2016 Roadmap on Diversity and Inclusion (Roadmap). On Sept. 3, the University sent out a follow-up email to the Hopkins community with an update on the Roadmap 2020 Task Force and Progress Report. In an interview with The News-Letter, junior Natalia Aguilar, a member of Female Leaders of Color (FLOC) as well as a First-Generation, Limited-Income (FLI) student, expressed her desire for the task force to prioritize Black perspectives and struggles. “I hope the task force takes into consideration not only Hopkins history with Baltimore, but the safety of its Black students — specifically, ending plans to create a private police force and amplifying Black student, faculty and community voices,” she said.

More than 200 members of the Hopkins community gathered in front of the Beach on Thursday, June 18 to demand that the University better hire and support Black faculty members, as well as cancel the planned private police force. The Black Faculty and Staff Association (BFSA) held the peaceful demonstration in solidarity with Black Lives Matter and the nationwide protests that have followed George Floyd’s killing by a white Minneapolis police officer. BFSA President Lorraine Smith, a senior grants and contract analyst at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, argued in an interview with The News-Letter that while Black people are hired for entry-level positions, they are not adequately represented in leadership roles. “Being Black at Hopkins can be limiting. We don’t get the same opportunities for advancement,” she said. “They are starting to listen to us — now is the time for change.” Muyinatu Bell, an assistant professor in

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available. Controversy erupted this past week over the arrest and subsequent death of Freddie Gray, a black Baltimore native. Gray, 25, died from a severe spinal cord injury on Sunday at the University of Maryland R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, one week after being arrested by Baltimore Police Department (BPD) officers at the 1700 block of Prestbury Street in West Baltimore. Six BPD officers involved in the case have been suspended with pay. “I’m determined to make sure that we have a full investigation and we follow all of the rules and procedures, so if there is a finding of wrongdoing… we can hold those individuals accountable,” Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said in a press conference on Monday. “I want to make sure that we get this right, that we continue to put out

University President Ronald J. Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar released the second progress report on the Roadmap on Diversity and Inclusion on Friday. University officials drafted the Roadmap, a document outlining plans to make Hopkins more diverse, following the Black Student Union’s (BSU) 2015 protests and list of demands. This update contains the first Staff Composition Report and statistics on the Faculty Diversity Initiative, which seeks to recruit and retain diverse faculty. In an email to The News-Letter, Fenimore Fisher, chief diversity officer, explained that the report demonstrates how Hopkins has progressed since the Roadmap’s creation. “Hopkins is committed to engaging fully a diversity of people, backgrounds, experiences and thought,” he wrote. “That commitment can be seen in the significant progress we’ve made since the first Roadmap on Diversity Report was published, especially concerning access to opportunity and broadening of networks for underrepresented minority (URM) students.” Fisher added that Hopkins

Almost two months ago, University President Ronald J. Daniels announced that a rope fashioned into a noose was found in a construction site of a Whiting School of Engineering lab at the Stieff Silver building on July 2. The University is currently investigating the incident through federal law enforcement and the Office of Institutional Equity. On July 27, the University sent a second email to the student body stating that the investigation was still ongoing and had no conclusive findings. Plano-Coudon, the contractor, has resumed construction on the site. Rising junior Rahwa Yehdego, vice president of the Black Student Union (BSU), emphasized in an email to The News-Letter that she feels disheartened by the lack of progress on the investigation, especially because it has been a month since the latest update from Hopkins. “That was a jarring moment for the Hopkins community, particularly the Black community, and it is frustrating

Historically, Hopkins has maintained a complex relationship with owning land and property in Baltimore. The University is the largest tax-exempt property owner in Baltimore and makes a significant economic contribution to the city. With $2.64 billion worth of properties, Johns Hopkins University & Medicine has an economic impact of more than $7.3 billion on the city, according to Assistant Vice President for Media Relations and News J.B. Bird in an email to The News-Letter. The City of Baltimore Real Property website lists 176 current properties owned by Johns Hopkins University, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Johns Hopkins Parking and Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. The list of properties encompasses a wide range of neighborhoods, including Mount Vernon, Middle East, Charles Village, Waverly and Bayview. Behind the University’s impressive track record of properties, however, are decades of redlining, gentrification and forced displacement.

Hopkins announced its purchase of the Dell House Apartments and the former Seaton High School this week in order to provide additional staff parking and office space. "The reason we purchased this 2.3 acre property was that it is close to the Homewood campus and was available at the right price," said James T. McGill, University Senior Vice President for Finance and Administration. The two buildings were owned by Sheppard Pratt Health Systems, which purchased them in 2000 for a combined $4 million. Their assessed value is now approximately $4.8 million, according to state land records. The University has used funds from its investments to pay for the properties. Dell House is a 16-story, 37-unit apartment building that is leased to both Hopkins students and the public. The former Seaton High School, a 67,000-square-foot office called Seaton Court, is leased to Argus Group Inc., a subsidiary of Automatic Data Processing

After nearly three months of consultation with community members, local businesses and University representatives, Baltimore developers are still working out plans for the Charles Village Project, which includes the construction of a new JHU bookstore and student housing, as well as redevelopment of the 3200 block of St. Paul Street. Struever Bros. Eccles & Rouse, Inc. (SBE&R), the Baltimore-based real estate development company in charge of the project, created the Charles Village Task Force in February. Composed of representatives from community and business associations, non-profits and institutions, the task force has met three times since its inception to discuss development plans. According to Charles Reyner, task force student representative, discussions focused on the St. Paul Street development, a smaller project than proposed JHU building construction. Plans for the west side of St. Paul Street between 33rd and 32nd Streets include ground-floor retail, approximately 40 market-rate apartments and a parking garage

While residents displaced by the East Baltimore Biotechnical Project blame Hopkins for their relocation, University officials claim that the urban redevelopment is an attempt to salvage one of the nation's most dilapidated and crime-ridden communities. In January 2004, residents of the East Baltimore area were informed through an article published in the Baltimore Sun -- rather than by the city of Baltimore itself -- that their homes would be acquired and demolished by the city for the development of the East Baltimore Biotechnical Project, which will provide Hopkins with laboratory space in the development's biotechnical and life sciences buildings. President William Brody called the area that will be demolished for the East Baltimore development -- 80 acres directly north of the Hopkins Medical Institute -- the "worst crime area in the United States" and reported that the condition of the neighborhood is such that "you could call in the National

 Dealing with the Dell - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

While we acknowledge that the relocation of Hopkins' humanities departments to the Dell House during Gilman's renovation is necessary, we find the University's treatment of Dell House residents upsetting. The departments' move to a centralized space is essential to maintaining the interdisciplinary interaction that defines the humanities at Hopkins. Unfortunately, the only viable option was the Dell House, an apartment building already occupied. The alternative, trailers scattered across campus, would be wholly unacceptable. The Dell House, while relatively far from the center of the Homewood campus, will nevertheless provide a space in which the humanities departments will be able to operate. We are disturbed, rather, by the manner in which the University has dealt with current Dell House residents. While the administration has been aware of the planned move since the spring, many Dell House residents remained completely ignorant of the pending relocation until a report in the News-Letter last

Residents of the Dell House will have to vacate their apartments by Feb. 1, 2008 as Hopkins looks to relocate faculty members displaced by the two-year renovation of Gilman Hall, according to University officials. Though the University decided last spring that offices would have to be moved to the Dell House, residents of the apartment building have yet to be officially informed. "Residents will receive official notices either Thursday or Friday," said Dennis O'Shea, Hopkins' executive director of communications and public affairs. "The notification letters are being proof-read right now." Residents of the Dell House are upset that they still have not been officially informed. "My main issue is that I was totally unaware of this until I read last week's News-Letter article," said Damiano Sandri, a Dell House resident.

The Dell House has become the new location for a myriad of departments due to the renovation of the iconic building that used to house them, Gilman Hall. The transition however, has faced several difficulties. One of the biggest concerns of the faculty within the Dell House, located between 28th and 29th Street on North Charles, has been the lack of office space. "The offices are much smaller than the Gilman offices. Faculty have had to put most of their books and papers in storage, or they have moved them to their homes. The department of history office is woefully cramped," History professor Judith Walkowitz said. This problem is aggravated by the fact that there are more faculty members than there are offices. "Three people are sharing an office that is smaller than my Gilman Hall office," History professor Franklin Knight said. "Shared office space means that individual faculty members

The location was sold to MCB Real Estate, who has yet to announce its plans for the lot going forward. The grocery, known for its deli and local brands, was a small store on St. Paul Street. Eddie’s had a close relationship with both the Hopkins community and Charles Village residents. Jerry Gordon, 73, has owned the store since 1980 and has worked at Eddie’s franchises since he was 15 years old. In an interview with The News-Letter, he explained that he chose to retire in order to spend more time with his family. “I’ve gotten mixed reactions from customers,” he said. “Some sad, some happy for me. ‘We’ll miss you,’ obviously. It’s been bittersweet, for me and for them.” Many in the Hopkins community were shocked and saddened by the news.

 After years of idleness, lot sees new plans - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By JACK BARTHOLET                                                     | September 27, 2012
After approximately four years of owning the Olmstead lot, the barren plot of land between St. Paul and Charles on 33rd Street, Hopkins is beginning to discuss potential plans for the lot’s future development. Purchased by Hopkins back in 2008 for $12.5 million, the development of the property is finally beginning to take off. Hopkins hired Sasaki Associates Inc., a firm based in Boston specializing in interdisciplinary planning and design, to complete a study examining several questions related to student life and students’ needs. Alan Fish, the Vice President for Real Estate and Campus Services, described the development delay as a result of challenging economic times. Fish credited University President Ron Daniels, with prompting the fruition of the St. Paul’s Street lot’s development. “The real driver of this is President Daniels. He has made it a real priority to want to use Johns Hopkins as an anchor institution here in

 3200 St. Paul construction on schedule - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

By Lauren Fang Staff Writer Since its ground-breaking ceremony last March, the 3200 St. Paul construction has evolved into a structural foundation with a first deck under the governance of Armada Hoffler and Beatty Development. “We started from the ground up with the footers and the foundation of the building,” said Darnell Sample, a laborer for Facchina, a concrete company that works alongside Hirsch electricians and Maamech plumbers and mechanics on-site. “Now we’re on the first deck, the second level.” The project is expected to house 31,500 square-feet of commercial space, including a CVS pharmacy. Parking for tenants and the public will also be available. According to Vice Provost for Student Affairs Kevin G. Shollenberger, the project’s goal is to provide upperclassmen with additional housing while continuing to vitalize Charles Village. “This project is also the kickoff for a new Charles Village retail, transportation and streetscape planning process,” Shollenberger said.

 Men's Lacrosse to move forward without head coach Pietramala - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Hopkins Athletic Director Jennifer S. Baker announced in a press release on Tuesday that the men’s lacrosse head coach, Dave Pietramala, will not be returning next season after 20 years of service to the program. The news comes as a shock to many, given Pietramala’s rich history at Hopkins. A former player for the Hopkins program, Pietramala won the William C. Schmeisser Award as the top defenseman in the nation twice and the Lt. Raymond Enners Award for most outstanding player. In addition, Pietramala was named a first-team All-American three times during his career and was a part of the 1987 National Championship team. Pietramala matched one of the most decorated lacrosse playing careers by becoming the program’s all-time winningest coach. Pietramala bounced around several institutions serving various roles, from assistant coach to defensive coordinator, before finally returning to his alma mater in 2000. After 20 seasons, Pietramala amassed a

It’s Saturday morning. You step outside your building hungover, 15 minutes late, organic tote bag in hand. You spy two figures waiting for you. One of them sports fading blue hair. Clearly, she’s not like other girls (newsflash: she is). The other figure wears a neck gaiter (okay Miss Rona) and oversized sunglasses. She could literally be anybody. You begin to walk. Within mere seconds, you spy your ex across the street and make eye contact. You walk another block. You spot a Tinder match and avert your gaze. You walk two more blocks. Is that Dr. Anthony Fauci? “We can go home now,” you tell your friends. “I’ve already been seen.” Indeed, if you’re a Hopkins student in Baltimore, going to the 32nd Street Farmers Market in Waverly is the only way in this economy for people to know you’re alive.

Following Eddie’s Market of Charles Village’s closure in December 2020, Streets Market filled its vacancy on St. Paul Street. Streets opened for business in June of this year. Jesamine Lee, brand manager of Streets, explained in an interview with The News-Letter that she hopes the grocery store will be able to carry on Eddie’s tradition of close relationships with students and residents alike. She explained that the store prioritizes product, price and service. “We’ve definitely been more diverse in terms of our grocery options,” she said. “There is a strong international community at Hopkins so we really focus on Asian grocery products and the basics of college life like instant ramen. But [we] also [focus on] providing healthy and fresh options like produce and ordering a lot of our items locally. We make sure we have really good variety so that when you go into our grocery store, you find

Do I even need to add a hook to this article? You know who she is, and as much as you may have tried to avoid it, you’ve heard of this album. The Tortured Poets Department, Taylor Swift’s new studio album, came out on Friday with 16 brand-new shiny songs, and then, two hours after its release, Swift announced 15 more songs as part of The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology. In this album, the highs are average and the lows are low. With the repetitive pop-synth production in the first half of the album and the recycling of the same melodies in the second half, as you listen, the album starts to lose its path. Suddenly, it feels like a bunch of words without meaning, like that reading for class you just can’t make sense of. Don’t get me wrong — despite Swift’s clear attempts to show her writing

The truth about my semester in Paris, France - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

I studied abroad in Paris last spring and it still comes up frequently. Naturally, when people learn that I studied abroad, they ask me about it. Not wanting to kill the mood, I usually find myself lying, or, at least, oversimplifying the situation. Typically I’ll admit that I didn’t love Paris, but that I appreciated the chance to travel and my great trip to Poland. I’ll say I made friends from other colleges that I’m still in touch with, and I’m lucky to have them in my life. I won’t say that I regretted going, much less explain why. In Paris, I was consumed by compounding feelings of grief and isolation following the death of my 21-year-old cousin, Thomas. I’ve written previously about dealing with homesickness in Paris and about making lists last summer, once I returned to the U.S., to get more in touch with my emotions, grief included.

There’s a sick dichotomy between Sept. 2, 2021 being my 19th birthday and Sept. 2, 2021 being the day my 20-year-old cousin, Thomas, was diagnosed with leukemia. There is also something nauseating about my use of the word “sick” when that is exactly what he is — trapped in the hospital undergoing chemotherapy when just weeks ago everything was perfectly normal, save for his toothache with an unknown cause. He is also, at present, nauseous, so I suppose I shouldn’t have used that word either. I am lucky. I have never experienced true loss. My first experience with death occurred when I was 5 years old, when my dog died and I point-blank asked my mother if I could see his skull. The only wakes I’ve attended have been for distant relatives — the service delivered entirely in Korean for my father’s uncle and the wake for my mother’s great

I have known three homes of my paternal grandparents: the Old Westbury house on Bacon Road — the one that my cousins say has since been painted to look like a Taco Bell — the Asharoken house on the north shore of Long Island and now, and finally, the one in Northport with the house number that always manages to slip my mind. Most of my favorite memories have the Asharoken home as their backdrop: the games of sardines where I hid in cramped closets, singing “This Land is Your Land” with my cousins on one of their visits to New York from California and, most notably, the walks on the beach every time my grandparents hosted a gathering. We always did this, especially on Thanksgiving. No one ever dressed quite warm enough to combat the outdoors, much less November’s chill when it worked in conjunction with the sea breeze

One of my goals for my semester abroad was to take a solo trip. I wasn’t sure where I wanted to go, but I knew that the experience would be crucial to learning more about myself. After sitting on the idea for some time, I decided to go to Kraków, Poland for a few reasons. First, I have Polish heritage on my mother’s side. I grew up eating some Polish foods prepared by my grandmother: pierogi, babka and kołaczki, to name a few examples, and I was very intrigued by the possibility of having Polish dishes in Poland. Though I was most familiar with the country’s culture in terms of food, I was also interested in the nation’s history and nature, making the trip very appealing. I ultimately decided between Warsaw and Kraków and booked a four-night stay in Kraków due to the wide array of attractions available as well

Even as a senior at Hopkins, I haven’t exactly mastered control over my own homesickness. Initially, this lack of proficiency was a product of not experiencing much homesickness early on in my time at Hopkins. More recently, during my semester abroad in Paris, I was overwhelmed by how isolated I felt. It’s likely that no one is completely in control of their homesickness, but over the years, I have found a few effective strategies to mitigate dwelling on it. Talk on the go I have made a habit of calling friends and family whenever I am doing basic tasks. I tend to call someone whenever I am folding laundry, walking to class, cooking or performing any other simple activity. As I recognize that I exhibit more extroverted tendencies than most others, I have found that this strategy saves me from having to specifically carve out time to keep in touch

Going into this summer, I knew it wouldn’t be about writing, but I told myself it would be — as if saying it could make it true. Honestly, I had hardly written in the winter and spring of 2023. At first, it was because I was busy adjusting to my life in a foreign country. As winter faded into spring, it was because I was grieving the loss of my cousin to leukemia. I had wanted to write about Paris, but I instead found myself blaming Paris for my misery, though it was merely the setting. I had this big idea about how I could write an incredible poem in my cousin’s honor, but I couldn’t do it. I still want to write that poem, but I still haven’t found the right words. In May, when I returned home from Paris and very quickly relocated to Boston for an internship,

The Tutorial Project is a Center for Social Concern program that pairs Baltimore school children with Hopkins students to provide tailored academic support in reading and mathematics. Sam Suh, an organizer at the Tutorial Project, clarified the organization's goal in an interview with The News-Letter. “The purpose of the Tutorial Project is to provide educational equity among Baltimore public schools,” he said. “Baltimore City Public Schools are not the best in terms of supporting students, and so our role is to provide a way for these elementary school children to get additional skills and resources to help them in their studies and beyond.” The program partners with schools in the Baltimore area to enroll students. Prior to the semester, organizers perform benchmark assessments to evaluate each child’s skills and weaknesses in reading and math. Based on the results, they create a personalized plan for each student to help them reach

The Tutorial Project has been serving the Baltimore community for 63 years by offering free after-school tutoring to elementary school students. The project is back in person this semester, but with one crucial difference: The program no longer has a bus service to transport students from their schools to the Homewood Campus. The program typically provides tutoring to approximately 120 children from Baltimore City public and charter elementary schools each year. This year the program has seen a decline in enrollment and more sporadic attendance due to the lack of reliable transportation. The Baltimore City Public School System’s underfunding creates barriers to student achievement. The poor conditions at many schools and lack of resources in the district pose challenges for parents, teachers and students alike, contributing to educational inequity. In an interview with The News-Letter, senior Josena Joseph, one of the organization's student directors, addressed how the Tutorial Project aims

At a packed Baltimore City Public Schools (BCPS) board meeting on Tuesday, hundreds of parents, teachers and students gathered to voice their outrage over heating problems that have affected classrooms since schools returned for the new year. Last week, about 60 BCPS closed after heating problems brought temperatures in the classrooms down to near-freezing levels. In the first week of January, the city saw unusually cold temperatures dropping into the single digits. Many of the schools were closed on Friday due to burst pipes and broken heating systems. Students bundled up in layers of coats and hats in order to stay warm in their classrooms. One attendee yelled to the board members that they were out of touch with what the families of Baltimore children were experiencing. “If your child was in school, if your child was that cold, what would you have done?” she said. “You don’t know how

I recently read a short story by Ted Thompson for my Intermediate Fiction course called “The Electric Slide.” The narrator of this story deals with random bouts of dementia, which he experiences as something akin to time travel — one night he’s in his first year of college, the next morning he wakes up years later, struggling to graduate while his peers have already gotten their diplomas and started their careers. I bring this story up because it’s similar to how I feel about this semester. A lot of things have changed in my life — as happens to everyone, over any extended period of time — but I still have this odd feeling, like I fell asleep after my intersession trip and woke up at the end of the semester, writing this final “To watch and watch for” for the semester, thinking over all the things I could have

91 felony counts. $355 million in civil fraud. Four indictments. But what does it all matter? Donald Trump’s legal woes have become something of a spectacle, with a new case or arraignment seemingly arriving every week. However, it seems that these felonies are having practically no impact on his presidential ambitions. In recent polls against incumbent President Joe Biden, Trump leads, and his approval ratings are also above the sitting president. This begs the question: Why do people not seem to care about Trump’s felonies, and which of his indictments, if any, may sway popular opinion? First off, let’s examine Trump’s four indictments. Although he faces dozens of other counts of felonies, these cases are the most serious and most likely to return verdicts before the presidential election in November. The first case revolved around hush money payments to an adult film star in 2016 with a charge of falsifying

While the patriarchy is certainly still strong in Western countries like the U.S., it is a different beast in South Korea. Among all countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), South Korea is at the bottom in gender income disparity rankings, with a whopping 31% difference in pay between men and women, despite its high GDP and standing as a developed country. Additionally, there has been a strong wave of anti-feminist movements across the country, boosted by the election of the conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol. Yoon claimed that structural gender discrimination no longer exists and promised to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. However, according to a 2021 survey, 1 in 3 Korean women have experienced some sort of gender-based violence, and their perpetrators were most likely current or former romantic partners, with most of these cases going unpunished or unresolved.

Growing up, I never really played — or liked — video games. I didn’t get the point. Watching my 4th-grade crush play Portal in his bedroom was boring. Okay, you get to the next level, and then you get to the last level and then what? You just play it all over again? Never mind the fact that I didn’t particularly enjoy games that hurt people violently. Games on the Wii were more tolerable, but then whenever I’d win (or more likely, lose), I’d think, “What’s next?” I held this mindset until I walked into my cousins’ bedroom while I was visiting them for Christmas and saw them playing a computer game. I looked over their shoulders and saw them styling a character, which wasn’t anything new — I’d play dress-up games on Girlsgogames for hours each day. However, after they finished fighting over which shirt to give her, they

The 2024 Spring Fair Concert at Hopkins, featuring singer-rapper Flo Milli, was electrifying. The initial announcement of her as the main Spring Fair Concert artist sparked some unhappy discourse among students, but those who attended the event went home exhilarated by an extremely fun performance. As students filtered in and found their place in the crowd, DJ Flow was hyping everyone up and taking song requests through Instagram DMs. He did a good job catering to the audience. I’ve never seen a group of people get so hyped up from a warm-up DJ, but it turns out all it takes is “Surround Sound” and “Gasolina” to get the Hopkins student body rolling. Electronic dance music trio Cheat Codes had a killer opening set, with some really cool drops, energizing the crowd. They repeatedly shouted out the center of the crowd who had their hands in the air the whole performance.

 University hosts hybrid Spring Fair - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Spring Fair 2021, which included virtual, hybrid and in-person events, was held Friday, April 23 through Sunday, April 25. In addition to pandemic-related changes, University administrators, rather than students, planned Spring Fair this year. They organized the weekend with input from the student body via groups such as the Hopkins Organization for Programming (HOP) and Hoptoberfest. This change was in response to last year’s controversy surrounding the Spring Fair Planning Committee’s misconduct allegations, which included hazing and underage drinking. The University fired several committee members, and others quit due to the changes. Director of JHUnions and Activities Hal Turner described this year’s Spring Fair planning process in an email to The News-Letter. “In order to gain as much student input as possible, the Spring Fair Planning Committee created an idea-share survey that was sent to Hopkins students and [Registered Student Organization] leaders requesting input on the types of activities and

Ignorance is not an excuse for hate - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Editor’s Note, 2024: This article was sent to The News-Letter for publication as an op-ed and completed the editing process prior to being posted elsewhere. To the Members of the Johns Hopkins Community, On Monday, April 29, the Beach became the site of a Palestine Solidarity Encampment, one of many on campuses across the nation. The encampment concerns many Hopkins students — the Jewish community included. The horrific attacks against Israel on Oct. 7 impacted us directly, with members of our community losing friends and family members. In the months since, we have mourned the loss of civilian lives — Israeli and Palestinian. We recognize the disheartening and disturbing conditions in Gaza. At the same time, we stand firm against Hamas — a terrorist organization committed to the destruction of the Jewish people. While the Hopkins Jewish community possesses a variety of opinions regarding the Israel-Hamas war, we are committed

For over three weeks, members of the Hopkins and Baltimore community have participated in a sit-in at Garland Hall to protest the proposed private police force and the University’s contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The protest was organized by Students Against Private Police (SAPP) and the Hopkins Coalition Against ICE (HCAI). As the sit-in continues, protesters are working to ensure that their platform centers marginalized voices. Mariam Banahi, a graduate student in the Department of Anthropology, explained that one goal the protesters have is to ensure that voices that are usually silenced are given a platform. Banahi stated that protesters reached out to Goldsmiths Anti-Racist Action, a group occupying a building at Goldsmiths, University of London to protest racism, for insight into how to make the sit-in more inclusive. “We’ve been in contact with the anti-racism occupation at Goldsmiths, and they’ve provided some necessary guidance on how

WJHU’s Spring Show: Rain or shine - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

It’s a rare sight to see Hopkins students so enthused by the arts. Theater gains attention mostly by faculty and alumni, and while the University’s plethora of acapella groups offer a great artistic community, their shows are scattered and inconsistent. One might even point to the Spring Fair Concert as evidence for a perceived interest in the arts by the student body, but as far as student performances go, there is only one main event which seems to receive broad interest across all demographics: the “Spring Show,” organized by WJHU Radio. We’re all lucky the Spring Show even happened this year. My friends and I went to the Beach to check it out at the planned time — 12:30 p.m., April 27 — even though it was raining, mainly because the promotional material stated quite boldly: “rain or shine.” Even the slight drizzle was apparently enough to stop the show,

 The Bohs: A group of rock-loving students thrive within an otherwise quiet Hopkins band scene - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

If one thing is certain when it comes to the arts community at Hopkins, it is each artist’s individual passion. Whether it’s the many theater groups, orchestras or underground coalitions of rock-loving musicians, the arts of our lady Homewood are alive and well. But is this hidden culture that courses through the student body recognized as much as it should be? One perfect example of this sometimes-hidden culture is The Bohs, a newly formed rock group made up of sophomores and seniors alike. I had the pleasure of interviewing the group as they rehearsed their performance for the student group showcase during Spring Fair. My first exposure to The Bohs came just this past weekend at Alpha Epsilon Pi’s Hopstock event, a party full of ‘60s love and hippie energy. The Bohs were the closing performance, playing songs like Fleetwood Mac’s “Chain” and Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Fortunate Son.” It was

When Julien Fenouil wanted to join the student radio station as a freshman in 2018, an upperclassman told him it wasn’t worth it. WJHU radio was dying, and Fenouil was busy adjusting to college life, so he put it off. The following year, the club had only one active member. Fenouil explained how he and his friend Amanda Fernandes crafted a plan last year to revive WJHU radio in an interview with The News-Letter. “We became presidents and used last year to bring the club back, to do events on campus like the spring show during Spring Fair, get a base of shows going, get people in the room again and get the club's name out there again,” he said. This year’s Co-Presidents Jasper Adams and Biz Stahl are running with the same momentum and have their sights set high. Both expressed gratitude to their predecessors in an interview with

The University held its 52nd Annual Spring Fair from April 27 to April 30. This year’s Spring Fair, following the precedent set by the previous two years, was planned by the Office of Leadership Engagement and Experiential Development (LEED) in collaboration with Hopkins Student Organization for Programming (HOP). The Spring Fair commenced with the Culture Show on Thursday, which showcased 12 different student groups. Following the show, students gathered in front of the Beach to watch the fireworks, while others watched from the comfort of their homes. In an interview with The News-Letter, senior Anthony Garcia described his experience watching the fireworks with his friends on the rooftop of his apartment. “All of us went up there to see it and it was a perfect view all the way down to the harbor. You can see the fireworks perfectly from there,” he said. “It was good fun and chill vibes

The first night of Culture Show has always been one of my favorite days of the semester. As the semester winds down, that familiar, heady mix of exam stress, despair and sleep deprivation begins to set in. And yet, the Culture Show never fails to make me forget all of that. For two electric hours, I’m completely absorbed in seeing what all the incredible cultural groups on campus have spent the semester preparing, learning about different styles of music and dance and being humbled by Hopkins students’ commitment to carrying tradition forward into our campus today. As I took my seat in Shriver Hall, I was amazed at how many people were there on a Thursday night on the last week of classes. It was more students than I’d ever seen in Shriver Hall before, and the crowd was buzzing. Presented by the Office of Multicultural Affairs, the theme for

 The evolution of The News-Letter in print - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

In March 2020, COVID-19 forced us to switch to daily, online-only production. Yet for the nearly 125 years before the pandemic, The News-Letter was a print (or a print-first) publication. The oldest paper in the Sheridan Libraries archive is our Oct. 14, 1897 issue. Back then, the paper was published every other week and cost 15 cents per copy or $1.50 for a yearly subscription. Some of the articles include a lecture at the School of Medicine and a piece about the institution of a College Congress at Hopkins. COURTESY OF THE UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES — SHERIDAN LIBRARIES This was just the fifth issue of the paper and the first of the paper’s second volume. Since then, beyond adding more staff and new sections like Opinions and Leisure, we’ve fundamentally reworked the look and goals of the paper and gone online. So, how did we get from 1800s-era print to where

And mounted over the door, a plaque which reads “News Letter Office.” It’s an interesting little structure, says Jim Stimpert, senior reference archivist for the University Archives. “I’ve wondered how many people going up Charles Street, sitting at the red light on Art Museum Drive, have looked over and said, ‘What the heck is that little thing doing over there?’” he said. The structure in question? The Gatehouse. It is either unknown to students or recognized as The News-Letter’s home. But as for why it’s there, on the southern corner of campus and mostly unacknowledged, well, that answer has changed over the 145 years since its construction. It is unknown where The News-Letter staff operated in its earliest days. At a point in the 1900s, the

 Howard Dean's Baltimore birthday bash - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Howard Dean is hunched down in the passenger seat of his white minivan, talking on his cell phone. It's 11:15 a.m. on a Monday morning in Baltimore and the Democratic presidential candidate is waiting to come out to a small rally organized for his one and only campaign stop in Charm City. Approximately 200 supporters have been trickling in since 10:15 a.m. on this foggy morning, carrying royal blue signs and homemade banners. "IN BAWLMER, WE BLIEVE IN DEAN," [sic] one sign reads. Here in Baltimore, like in the rest of America, Dean is running on a slogan of "Take our country back" and recent polls suggest strong support for the former governor from Vermont in the Democratic primary race. While the crowd stands in a quiet huddle, a news ticker on a nearby building flashes: "Dean leads 44 percent to Kerry 23 percent in New Hampshire Poll." As one

Those of us who choose the non-Greek path of the undergraduate social scene only see the culmination of the fraternity party process, the celebration itself. But after speaking to members from different fraternities on campus, one learns that the few hours you spend at their house on a weekend night actually represents only a fraction of the time that is put into the event. It must be planned, advertised, and when the big night comes, such a gathering must be orchestrated to ensure the safety and satisfaction of those in attendance. However, learning about the planning process of the average fraternity gala at Johns Hopkins leaves one with an unanswered query; included in all that must be done, can separate the average Greek celebration from a great fraternity party?

A $30 million superstructure. An extension to the Milton S. Eisenhower Library (MSEL). A place where students will be able to hang out and study. These were only some of the descriptions Winston Tabb, the Sheridan Dean of University Libraries and Museums, used to detail what the swanky new Brody Learning Commons (BLC) would look like. The BLC is still under construction, and is projected to be finished next summer. The Brody Learning Commons was conceived in order to give students what they couldn’t get from the MSEL. “In the process of gaining feedback of what the students wanted in the BLC that the MSEL lacked, we noticed a common grievance,” Tabb said. “The MSEL was a bunker of sorts, where students felt a lack of natural light. In the course of designing the BLC, we saw this as our top priority. We made sure that students will have plenty

There has really been only one thing in the news this week. I am referring of course to the successful raid by Navy SEALs of a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, culminating in the death of Osama Bin Laden. On May 1st, the FBI’s most wanted terrorist was finally killed nearly 10 years after he masterminded the 9/11 tragedy and after 30 years of violent jihadist terrorism. That day was coincidently my birthday and the news definitely added an extra bit of cheer to my day, as it did to most Americans and justice loving people the world over. Bin Laden’s death is the crowning achievement of America’s ongoing War on Terror and has been handled successfully by the White House. Everything about the whole operation has showed me how America has adapted to the type of irregular warfare that has proved troublesome for quite some time.From the planning to the

Late Sunday night, after President Obama announced that a Specil Forces Team had located and killed Osama Bin Laden, spontaneous celebrations erupted across the country, including on the Homewood campus and in Charles Village. Some students even went to Washington D.C. to join the revelry that broke out around the White House. However, this reaction to Bin Laden’s death was highly controversial. Some students, like senior Tyler Smith, thought the revelry was in poor taste. “Whether or not one believes that killing Bin Laden was morally justified, a death is never cause for celebration. His death is cause for solemn reflection on everything we lost on September 11, and have lost since.” Smith said. Other students, like senior Aaron Jones, found nothing wrong with the positive response. “I think when evil people die it’s a good thing and too many good people die on this planet for me to mourn

 Hopkins memes: moronic or memorable? - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Some time in the last week, a new Facebook group Johns Hopkins Memes went viral on the newsfeeds of many Hopkins students. The emergence of the new group is part of a larger Facebook trend: college students across the nation are creating "meme pages" to spread information about their school to others who attend. Some might be asking, "what exactly is a meme?" A meme, pronounced "meem" and not "me-may" or "may-may," is simply a means of spreading any sort of information through the internet. Some of the most popular memes are accompanied by pictures — sometimes a cat or cute puppy, a character from a movie, a famous celebrity or even an ordinary person. Some of the most popular memes on the internet include "lolcats," "rickrolling," "it's over 9000!," "this is SPARTA!," "good guy Greg" and "socially awkward penguin." Of course, the ingenuity of memes is varied — some

Although we reviewed Uni Mini in one of our previous columns, we thought it was necessary to revisit this hub of campus despite their questionable salads. Instead of focusing on its food, we decided to appreciate Uni Mini as an experience. Determined to get the behind-the-scenes dish, we asked our new favorite Uni Mini employee, Basam, for the inside scoop. We told Basam, "We're not numbers people, but we're fairly sure that 99 percent of Hopkins students that frequent Uni Mini do so with blurred vision. Haven't you ever wondered what the scene looks like from the other side of the counter?" "You mean drunk people?" Basam asked, his immediate response to us after we had explained the premise of our article. Needless to say, those behind the Uni Mini counter remember your night more clearly than you do.

Yeah, I don't even know what this means. I think I cried when I heard this quote because it was so entirely bizarre. Do you bite your siblings? I have one older sister and I can tell you for a fact that I have never ever had the desire to bite her. I don't know about you, but I generally reserve the act of biting for things that are dead and processed like steamed broccoli or writing utensils. Biting is such a primal behavior. In the animal kingdom, biting can signify aggression, affection, hunger, boredom, communication, frustration....yeah, a lot of emotions. My dog used to bite the wooden legs of our piano when her teeth were growing in. That emotion is called "teething", Human babies could probably empathize.

Members of the U.S. Secret Service gathered in an undisclosed location in Laurel, MD this week for a two-day ethics training course conducted by professors and administrators from the Hopkins School of Education. The semi-covert session came two and a half weeks after twelve Secret Service agents allegedly solicited prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia, where President Barack Obama had traveled to attend the sixth Summit of the Americas. The ensuing controversy has made headlines across the country and prompted official inquiries into the Secret Service agency; University officials, however, said that the ethics forum was always scheduled to take place and is not remedial. “We had this course planned long before the Cartagena issue,” Christopher Dreisbach, who heads the School of Education’s Department of Applied Ethics and Humanities for the Division of Public Safety Leadership, said.

Hopkins students called for justice for Freddie Gray at a student-led protest on Wednesday afternoon. The group gathered in front of the Beach and walked down N. Charles Street to Penn Station, where they joined other college and high school students from across the city. The Homewood protest was organized by the Black Student Union (BSU) and Hopkins Feminists. Protesters held up posters that said “Hopkins Cares” and “Am I Next?” and chanting, “All night, all day, we will fight for Freddie Gray.” Many of the students wore shirts that said “Black Lives Matter,” and many others wore black clothing. Students marched from the Beach to Gilman Hall and protested on the front steps before looping back to N. Charles Street to proceed to Penn Station, then City Hall. They joined students from Goucher College, Towson University and other local schools to protest downtown. Despite initial concerns over the protesters’

Baltimore residents took to the streets this past week to protest the death of Freddie Gray, who died on April 19 from a spinal cord injury after his arrest a week earlier. While the protests have largely remained peaceful, pockets of violence erupted on Saturday evening, and by Monday night, riots caused the University to order students on Homewood Campus to remain indoors. In an email to the University community Tuesday night, President Ronald J. Daniels condemned the violence as inexcusable and joined those across the city who are seeking answers to the circumstances surrounding Gray’s death. “We join those who are endorsing the urgency of a full and independent investigation of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Gray’s death,” he wrote. “It is essential that all of our city’s citizens have trust and confidence in professional and fair treatment by our police.” Gov. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency and

The Homewood protest was organized by the Black Student Union (BSU) and Hopkins Feminists. Protesters held up posters that said “Hopkins Cares” and “Am I Next?” and chanting, “All night, all day, we will fight for Freddie Gray.” Many of the students wore shirts that said “Black Lives Matter,” and many others wore black clothing. Students marched from the Beach to Gilman Hall and protested on the front steps before looping back to N. Charles Street to proceed to Penn Station, then City Hall. They joined students from Goucher College, Towson University and other local schools to protest downtown. Despite initial concerns over the protesters’

Freddie Gray’s death has been ruled a homicide, and six officers have been charged in the case, Baltimore State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced Friday. Three of the Baltimore Police Department officers are charged with involuntary manslaughter, and one is charged with second-degree murder. All have charges of assault and misconduct in office, and warrants were issued for their arrests. Officer Caesar Goodson, Jr., the driver of the van, has been charged with second degree depraved-heart murder, involuntary manslaughter, second degree negligent assault, manslaughter by vehicle by means of gross negligence, manslaughter by vehicle by means of criminal negligence and misconduct in office for failure to secure prison and failure to recognize render aid. Lieutenant Brian Rice has been charged with involuntary manslaughter, assault in the second degree, misconduct in office and false imprisonment.

 Mosby drops charges against BPD officers in Freddie Gray case - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By CATHERINE PALMER                                                     | July 28, 2016
All charges against the remaining three Baltimore Police Department (BPD) officers implicated in the death of Freddie Gray were dropped yesterday morning. The decision by the office of Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby came after unsuccessful prosecutions of four of the officers between December 2015 and July 2016. The decision to drop charges against Officer Garrett Miller, Officer William Porter and Sergeant Alicia White was announced by Chief Deputy State’s Attorney Michael Schatzow during Miller’s pre-trial hearing on Wednesday. Gray, a 25 year old black man, was transported from the scene of his arrest in Sandtown-Winchester on April 12, 2015 to the Western District police station in a BPD van without being properly restrained. According to the state medical examiner’s office, Gray sustained a fatal spinal cord injury during the “rough ride.” Gray’s death one week after his arrest sparked both peaceful and violent protests, garnering national attention.

 Five years after the Baltimore Uprising, we must commit to fighting inequality beyond times of crisis - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By THE EDITORIAL BOARD                                                     | April 30, 2020
Five years ago, Baltimore residents took to the streets to protest the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man from Sandtown-Winchester. Gray died on April 19 from a severe spinal cord injury sustained while in police custody, yet no officer was convicted. Some call the protests “riots.” We call them the Baltimore Uprising. Despite moments of violence that drew disproportionate amounts of national attention during those weeks, the protests were largely peaceful. Gray’s death was one of many instances of police brutality against black residents in Baltimore, catapulting thousands of people — including Hopkins students — into a fight against the systemic inequalities of our city. The Uprising was a turning point for activism on campus. On April 29, 2015, the Black Student Union (BSU) joined demonstrators downtown to protest racial profiling and unjust treatment of black Baltimoreans. Under the leadership of groups like BSU, students pressured the University

As Hopkins transitioned into remote learning in mid-March, so did its student organizations. Community-service based groups in particular have found creative ways to stay active even though many of their members are no longer living in the Baltimore communities which the groups serve. Sophomore Alanna Horowitz is a student volunteer for Thread, an organization which connects student volunteers and community-based volunteers with high-school students in Baltimore. Typically, volunteers support their student both academically, via tutoring, and emotionally, by engaging in their life and checking in on their well-being. In an interview with The News-Letter, Horowitz likened the current situation to times when she has gone home on break. She is one of many volunteers assigned to a pair of twins, others of whom reside full-time in Baltimore. She noted that the distance makes it hard for her to support both students in the ways she can while living on campus.

The structure in question? The Gatehouse. It is either unknown to students or recognized as The News-Letter’s home. But as for why it’s there, on the southern corner of campus and mostly unacknowledged, well, that answer has changed over the 145 years since its construction. It is unknown where The News-Letter staff operated in its earliest days. At a point in the 1900s, the

Hopkins is known as a breeding ground for successful professionals. Whether these professionals are doctors, academics, researchers, engineers or lacrosse players, Hopkins has gained a reputation for placing highly skilled people into high-ranking workforce positions. But is Hopkins also a breeding ground for legendary basketball coaches? Initial research breeds one positive result. Can you guess who it is? I'll give you three clues. He coached his team to an upset victory in the 1983 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game. At the 1993 ESPY Awards he gave one of the most noteworthy and memorable speeches by any sports figure. He has a cancer research foundation established in his memory, which to date has raised over $70 million. The man is James "Jim" Valvano - affectionately referred to by sports junkies as Jimmy V.

Over the past 100 years, Johns Hopkins has had a voluminous history. Replete with breakthroughs and advancements in science, engineering, academia, and education, Hopkins has become one of the world's most elite universities. So what are some of the constants during this century of illustriousness? Hard work? Dedication? Inspiring cafeteria food? How about a staple of the Homewood campus since 1907, the aptly named, Homewood Field. According to "A History of the University" by John French, before the Homewood campus was home to Johns Hopkins, it was fairly difficult to make provisions for sports. The original campus was in downtown Baltimore City, and in order to provide athletics for both undergraduate and graduate students, the school laid out fields for baseball, lacrosse, and football at Clifton Park. But in 1895, Clifton became a public park and reservoir, which meant that Hopkins could not use it for recreation. Players made use

Sixteen individuals, including four undergraduates, one graduate student and one professor from Hopkins, were taken into custody early Wednesday morning after Baltimore City Police intervened to break up a peaceful 500-person celebration of the election results at 33rd and St. Paul Streets. According to witnesses at the scene, Jeffrey Levine, a Hopkins sophomore, was walking home from an election party at around 1 a.m. when he was pushed by police into the lobby of the Bradford apartments, and after confronting the police, he was Tasered. "I definitely saw him being Tasered or shocked or whatever they did to him. At that point he kind of fell backwards and the police grabbed him away into the paddy wagon," said Galen Druke, a Hopkins freshman who witnessed blue sparks from the stun device.

The Hopkins Department of Athletics and Recreation has announced that both men's and women's varsity crew teams will be discontinued, effective at the end of the spring 2009 season. The decision, made last Thursday, was financially motivated. "It is perhaps the most difficult thing I've done in my 20 years here," Director of Athletics Tom Calder said, referring to the decision to disband the crew teams. Calder has spent the last 13 years at Hopkins as athletic director. "The fact that today's poor economic condition is forcing all colleges and universities to begin cutting back in many areas, including student services, only pushed this growing fiscal problem to the surface and made it an immediate budgetary decision," Calder said. The combined crew budgets are currently the most expensive budgets, after the men's and women's lacrosse NCAA Division I budgets, and the costs have continued to increase. As a sport, the

Hopkins undergraduate John Pontolillo, used a samurai sword to kill an intruder in his off-campus residence at the 300 block of E. University Parkway early Tuesday morning. Police detective Donny Moses of the Baltimore Northern Police District reported that the intruder bled out on the scene. According to University spokesman Dennis O'Shea, Hopkins is finding alternate housing for all residents of the house in question. They would also be offered any assistance from Hopkins, including counseling, should it be required. "There may be other things they ask of us, but only time will tell," O'Shea said. The News-Letter confirmed that Pontolillo was the student in question through a number of anonymous sources. The senior from Wall, N.J., has not yet been charged with any crime, although investigations remain ongoing, according to Moses. At around 1:20 a.m, officers were called by a neighbor who reported a suspicious person on the front

Though his controversial blog of sexploits is banned by JHGuestnet, Hopkins paid for students to get the full Tucker Max "experience" in person from his speech on Wednesday. While Max spoke to a crowded Shriver Hall, around 170 people went to a dinner and discussion at One World Cafe to protest his presence on campus. Max opened his speech by saying, "There's enough nerds in here for a Star Trek convention." Max quickly identified the absence of any protesters. "They'd be f--king pissed off if they knew how much I was getting paid for this story. I'd like to buy a new f--king car with what they're paying me. It's kind of embarrassing," Max said. The exact amount paid to Max could not be verified.

Fencer Max Wieder knew exactly what was on the line this past weekend at the NCAA Regionals; the senior only needed to win seven more bouts to break the school record for most career wins in Sabre. “I knew coming into Regionals that I was only a few wins away, and while a trip to the NCAA championships was also on the line, it was really important to me to get that record,” Wieder said. In this spirit, Wieder secured his seventh victory of the day against UNC, and tacked on one additional win, to solidify his place in Hopkins fencing history. For his career, Wieder finished with 322 wins, breaking the previous record of 320 — a mark which had stood for 31 years. “My parents were there and when I won the bout I threw my mask off and ran around giving everyone hugs,” he said. “I always

President-elect Donald J. Trump’s unlikely victory early Wednesday morning stunned people across the nation and around the world. The results shocked Hopkins students, many of whom expressed frustration and fear. In response, students spray painted the mural boards outside of Brody Learning Commons with phrases including ‘Grab them by the p*ssy’; ‘Do I deserve rights?’; ‘Mourn 4 the USA’; ‘Racism Wins’; and ‘Never Trump.’ Outside the Fresh Food Cafe (FFC), the Blue Jay statue was painted with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign logo and the words ‘F**k Trump’ superimposed. Other students sported Trump apparel on campus. The Republican Party kept control of Congress, winning a majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives. Co-president of Hopkins Feminists Linda Horn worried that Trump’s victory, which depended on the white vote, could threaten marginalized communities in the United States. “People are processing, and with processing comes some shock, sadness, anger and

On the day following President Donald Trump’s inauguration, millions of Americans took to the streets for the largest single-day demonstration in U.S. history. At the Women’s March on Washington, which took place on Jan. 21, protesters demonstrated for women’s and worker’s rights, immigration reform, and LGBT+ and racial equality. Sister marches around the world took place simultaneously in solidarity. In Baltimore, a gathering on 33rd and Charles Street drew several thousand people. There were 673 marches worldwide, on all seven continents. Over 500,000 people marched in Washington D.C., with over 4.9 million participants worldwide. The march was organized online following Trump’s election. Hopkins students who participated in the Women’s March sat down with The News-Letter to share their experiences at the historic event. They described what the march meant to them and expressed their concerns about the Trump administration. Angie Walker, Sophomore Sophomore Angie Walker attended the sister march in

Vice Provost for Student Health and Well-Being Kevin Shollenberger announced in an email to the student body on Wednesday that SilverCloud — an online, self-guided mental health resource — is now free and available to full-time Hopkins students and trainees. “SilverCloud offers 24/7 access to interactive learning modules that teach cognitive behavioral therapy techniques for approaching life’s challenges and managing mild-to-moderate symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns,” Shollenberger wrote. Sophomore Amanda Howard, a Public Health major, believes that SilverCloud can benefit individuals who are working to enrich their lives. However, she called on the University to implement more crisis resources in an email to The News-Letter. “The app is a step towards the institution recognizing that suffering from depression and anxiety is far too common here.

As part of an ongoing effort to make mental health resources more accessible to the Hopkins community, the Counseling Center has begun promoting Calm, an app that offers guided meditation, bedtime stories and music to help people relax and de-stress. Earlier this year, a liaison from Calm contacted the Counseling Center and the Student Government Association (SGA) about sharing the app with Hopkins students. Starting this semester, students, faculty and staff may subscribe to the app during the University’s year-long free trial. Christine Conway, associate director of outreach and sexual assault services at the Counseling Center, said that according to the company around 500 Hopkins affiliates have downloaded Calm since The Hub first advertised it on Oct. 4.

I never thought I’d make it to graduation, and I mean this in every single literal sense. When I first became depressed, I was convinced that the campus was poisoning me, infusing me with a sadness that was not my own. I desperately searched left and right for reasons outside myself. I spent the entire summer before my sophomore year scared of coming back to school. My dread reached levels of pure incomprehension. At first, I thought I knew what it was I couldn’t bear: the thought of returning to campus following an incredibly difficult freshman year

When I first heard this statistic, I was rather shocked. Throughout my life, my family has ingrained in me the importance of education. I asked myself, “Why do others fail to share these values?” Like many other Hopkins students, my parents are immigrants who traveled to the U.S. for a chance at a more equitable life. As a Public Health graduate, I now understand that despite one’s motivations and desire for mobility, there are still complex socioeconomic factors that keep everyday people from achieving higher education. For that, I am blessed and I

From the friendships formed in the traditional dorm halls of the AMRs or the long nights spent alone in a study room closed off to the world, Hopkins has given me some great times. It does feel a little strange that I’m graduating because I don’t feel any different as an unemployed adult versus as a full-time student. As a student here, there are many important things that the average high school applicant wouldn’t know about Hopkins. Here are some of those things: Student culture and diversity There is no such thing as the

Sapere aude!” Immanuel Kant screams at me from his essay on enlightenment. “Have the courage to think for yourself.” I look up from my desk on D-Level and feel the bones in my neck crack. It’s been a while since I’ve seen the sun, so I’m pretty sure you can use the fluorescent lights to see through my skin and into my vital organs. Think for yourself. That sounds like pretty good advice, but who has the time? I’m a workaholic. I’ve spent many a weekend, late night and early morning in the dark recesses of the library. I’ve fallen asleep while reading in bed and woken up with highlighter all over my face. I’ve cried in Gilman because I couldn’t make my rhyming couplets work before a deadline, and it is more than fair to say that, at times, I’ve bitten off more than I could chew. At Hopkins,

My friends and I have talked about the exact moment when we found out we got into Hopkins. Everyone remembers their own story in almost perfect detail. I was sitting in my German class on Dec. 14 watching Elf, more nervous than I had ever been, waiting until the clock hit 2:00 p.m. CST. When it hit, I waited three more minutes because I was too terrified to open the admissions website and find out. After the suspense became too much, I opened the early decision portal and logged in. I saw the words “You’ve Been Admitted” and I started crying. My teacher let me go to the hallway and call my parents. The smile on my face didn’t leave for the rest of the day. A lot of our stories went the same way, ending in the jubilation that only a college acceptance can provoke. One of my friends

In March of 2018, The News-Letter reported that Residential Advisors (RA) on financial aid were paying the same out-of-pocket costs — which include tuition and room and board — as they would have been without their position. RAs revealed that they were given room and board via a grant, which was partially or totally subtracted from their Hopkins financial aid packages. This meant that RAs who were receiving financial aid greater than the cost of room and board were essentially working without pay. Several months later, The Office of Residential Life announced that it had revised its RA contract for the 2019-20 academic year, which included an annual stipend of $5,100 to be paid in semi-monthly installments. However, the RA manual now states that RAs are unable to speak directly to media outlets without permission from their supervisors. This year, seven RAs broke this rule to inform The News-Letter of

Students who apply to become Residential Advisors (RAs) assume that one of the benefits of the position will be that their overall costs for the year will decrease. However, RAs who receive financial aid have raised concerns that their out-of-pocket (OOP) costs, which include tuition and room and board, have not decreased significantly since accepting the position. On the other hand, RAs who do not receive financial aid see a dramatic decrease in their overall OOP costs. This academic year, the University provided RAs with free room and board in the form of a $16,858 grant. Students on financial aid typically receive a JHU Grant, which is awarded based on an individual student’s need. According to RAs who receive financial aid, the RA Grant is partially or totally subtracted from their JHU Grant. As a result, their OOP costs remains about the same.

“I started thinking about the jobs I had on campus and how I was going to support myself in terms of rent. How would I pay? Do I go home?” That is how senior Sean Stielow, a First-Generation Limited-Income (FLI) student, recalled his reaction to the announcement on March 10 that in-person classes would be canceled through at least April 12. Eight days later, online classes were extended through the end of the semester. The ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and its effects are exposing and deepening inequality across the country. The University has extended over $5 million to students and their families in the form of emergency grants; however, the pandemic and transition to remote learning still pose unique challenges for students from low-income families and students who are the first in their family to attend college.

Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Sunil Kumar announced in an email to the student body that the Krieger School of Arts & Sciences (KSAS) and Whiting School of Engineering (WSE) will adopt a universal satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) grading system this semester. The email, which was sent on March 27, states that the administration acknowledges that the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak — which prompted all University courses to proceed online — pose a variety of challenges that not all students would share. An additional email sent by KSAS and WSE clarified that all undergraduate grades will be limited to S or U grades with no impact on a student’s overall GPA. Additionally, all courses necessary for degree requirements can be fulfilled by a satisfactory grade. The universal S/U grading policy will be automatically applied to all courses, with no opt-in or opt-out option. Because professors will register

Following the University’s announcement that students would not be allowed to remain in on-campus housing past March 15 amid the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, The News-Letter interviewed residential students about their transition to off-campus housing. Many of the students were frustrated by having to negotiate new housing arrangements on short notice and felt that the University did not give them sufficient information throughout the process. Charles Commons resident Yoko Yamashita, an international student from Japan, stated that the University made moving off campus extremely difficult. “My experience has been full of confusion, anxiety and frustration,” she said. “The whole process could not have been any harder... They kind of just left us to do everything by ourselves.” McCoy Hall resident Brian Li echoed Yamashita’s sentiments. “It’s just been frankly a blur. We really weren’t given a lot of time to react,” he said. “We just had to try to pack

 SGA endorses letter to Daniels asking for partial tuition remission - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

The Student Government Association (SGA) endorsed a letter calling on University President Ronald J. Daniels and Board of Trustees Chair Louis J. Forster to remit 25 percent of students’ spring 2020 tuition at their weekly meeting on March 31. SGA also discussed how it will continue operating in the wake of the cancellation of in-person classes and heard a presentation from a group of graduate students on issues with the Student Conduct Code violation adjudication process. Senior Class President Pavan Patel, who prepared the letter, argued that this would be an appropriate way to compensate students for the loss of half-of-a-semester’s worth of in-person instruction and campus access while not hampering the University’s ability to meet its payroll obligations. Asking students to pay regular tuition during an irregular situation, Patel said, is not right. “We understand the situation and fully appreciate the work that’s being done. But at the end

Johns Hopkins Medicine will open the Center for Transgender Health by early spring of next year. The Center aims to provide transgender people with a lifelong healthcare program. The News-Letter sat down with Paula Neira, the new director of the center and a former officer in the U.S. Navy. Neira left the military to transition from male to female, and now works as a nurse educator at Hopkins. Healthcare services provided by the Center will include gender affirmation surgeries and other services for transgender people to receive proper medical treatment. After the new year, the Center will begin working with adult patients who have already contacted the hospital for gender affirmation surgery. Neira spoke about the ongoing discrimination faced by the trans community in healthcare. “The transgender population faces lots of health disparities,” she said. “One of the initiatives at Johns Hopkins Medicine is to look at health disparities and

For months, activists have criticized the University for failing to condemn a paper published by two Hopkins affiliates in The New Atlantis last August. The paper suggests that biology does not play a role in determining sexuality and gender identity and argues that children who identify as a different gender will likely grow out of it. In response to the report’s publication, this March the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) deducted 25 points from Johns Hopkins Hospital’s Healthcare Equality Index (HEI). The HEI evaluates healthcare facilities’ practices related to their treatment of LGBT+ communities. The report was co-authored by Lawrence Mayer, a scholar in residence at the School of Medicine, and Paul McHugh, a professor of psychiatry there. While the University has not released an official statement, Hopkins faculty and community members have opposed the paper. Over 600 people signed a petition demanding that the University publicly disavow the report. Last

This semester, the University hired Fenimore Fisher, its first vice provost for diversity and inclusion and chief diversity officer. He joined the Hopkins community on Oct. 23. Fisher has spent over 20 years working on diversity and inclusion initiatives. He previously worked as chief diversity officer for New York City. He was also vice president of diversity initiatives and analysis for Walmart and began his diversity career in the nonprofit sector. As chief diversity officer of Hopkins, Fisher will primarily be responsible for overseeing the University’s Roadmap on Diversity and Inclusion. He also serves as a co-chair of the University’s Diversity Leadership Council (DLC). In addition, Fisher is an adjunct faculty member at New York University. He believes Hopkins has been progressive in its efforts around diversity and inclusion as compared to its peer institutions. “Many colleges and universities are trying to accelerate their efforts,” he said. “What I do

Starting this semester, Blackboard and the Student Information System (SIS) will pull preferred name information directly from myJH. The initiative builds on updates made this past spring, which allowed Hopkins students, staff and faculty to designate a preferred name on myJH profiles. This is one of the changes that a special committee implemented to improve the University’s online systems. The committee had support from IT@JHU, the Office of Institutional Equity, Human Resources and LGBTQ Life. To promote a more inclusive and safe environment, the people who spearheaded this change recognized the insufficiency of the “nickname” option that was previously offered and added the “preferred name” option as part of the myProfile section in the myJHU portal. Junior James Dweck, who is transgender, described his excitement upon logging into Blackboard and discovering that his name was appropriately reflected. “I went through a legal name change last October, so almost a year

Most obviously, a global pandemic turned all our in-person lectures into Zoom calls, moving our desks from our classrooms to our bedrooms. Some of you graduates pulled all-nighters every night to take classes from the other side of the world, while others here in Baltimore were made to spit into little plastic vials three times a week to be allowed on campus. And while all this was happening, you witnessed (and often participated in) a presidential election, protests and political unrest during one of the most hectic and inconsistent years in the Univeristy’s history.But even before your senior year,

 A letter to my freshman self, plus cicadas - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By RUDY MALCOM                                                     | May 27, 2021
Fully vaccinated and hoping to feel something, I went to Power Plant Live! last Thursday for the first time since the pandemic started. As I squeezed past peers I hadn’t been indoors with in eons, I was reminded of the Brood X cicadas that have descended upon the nation. With life seemingly returning to “normal” in the United States, we are emerging en masse like those horny, red-eyed banshees. We’ve spent what feels like 17 years underground, and we are loud, emotionally starved and half-dead shells of who we used to be. In the past two weeks, I, with the energy of a cicada, have tried to do as many things and see as many people as possible. While I didn’t ride the bull at Power Plant last week, I am trying to live my life to the fullest before I graduate. It’s similar to what the cicadas are doing

 A taste of home in Baltimore: on friendship and hot pot - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By YANNI GU                                                     | May 27, 2021
Located in Towson among many other shops and restaurants is a small, Chinese all-you-can-eat hot pot place called New Generation. It is a familiar location to many Hopkins students, but for me, it’s something even more special. Hot pot, the literal translation of which from Chinese is “fire pot” (火锅), is a traditional cuisine originating from the Sichuan province. With a history of over 2000 years, it has spread across the entire nation and now even the whole world, gaining popularity and love. However, I never liked hot pot when I was growing up. It was always too loud and warm; the taste became monotonous after everything was dipped in the same sauce and there always was an aftertaste from the soup full of additives that just made me scream “WATER.” Shortly after coming to Hopkins, one of my Chinese friends suggested going to New Generation in Towson. I was

After rounds of delays due to the pandemic, the grand release of the live-action movie Mulan had gained a lot of hype and excitement. However, this only made it extra disappointing when I finally watched it. After its release in Chinese cinema on Sept. 11, the rating dropped sharply to 4.9/10 on Douban within two days. So, without a doubt, I am able to say: I did not enjoy the movie at all nor the cinematic imperialism it represents. The story follows the journey of Mulan, who has been scolded by her mother from a young age to be less plucky. “A daughter brings honor through marriage,” her mother tells her. But when Mulan’s father, a wounded warrior, must join the army to maintain familial honor, Mulan grabs his sword and rides off into the night and sacrifices herself to protect him.

Is it safe to travel and share meals? What will spring semester look like? Fortunately, recent news has been dominated by breakthroughs related to a vaccine for the virus. Two types of vaccines show promise. The mRNA vaccines are less likely to provoke adverse reactions, but they may be hard to deliver to tropical regions due to the requirement of storage at incredibly low temperatures. The other type of vaccine consists of the inactivated virus, like Russia’s Sputnik V, China’s Sinovac and China National Biotec Group vaccines. They do not require subzero storage but are slightly more likely

However, with the authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and Moderna and many others on the horizon, normal life seems to be within reach — if and only if we as a society decide to take this vaccine. For this and for many other reasons, Hopkins should mandate the COVID-19 vaccine when it is available for us to take it.

It’s been almost two months since Taylor Swift dropped evermore, her second album of 2020, when the world was devoid of severity, compassion and inspiration. It was a nice surprise to her fan base — myself included — after the initial release of evermore’s sister album in July of 2020, folklore. Among songs of distinct themes and genres, I notice a common thread that strings together the two albums: escapism. Without a doubt, folklore and evermore are the culmination of Swift’s imagination and hard work amid a pandemic that shook the world, but they are also media Swift uses to distract herself from the woes, anger and tragedies of an unprecedentedly chaotic year. On August 21, Swift explained that she has her own way of looking at the songs on folklore: To her, they fit together thematically in different groups and “chapters.” The first one she shared is “folklore: the

The 10th anniversary of the Fukushima Daiichi accident, when an unexpected earthquake generated a tsunami that destroyed the nuclear power plant’s backup generators, fell on March 11. The loss of power and consequent failure of the cooling system resulted in the elevation of residual heat. In an attempt to cool things down, seawater was continuously pumped to the reactor, but ultimately the core still partially melted down. Since then, the disposal of this radioactive seawater has presented a challenge. On April 13, Japan announced its decision to release the Daiichi wastewater into the Pacific Ocean. The biggest driver for this decision was that the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company, would run out of storage by fall of 2022. According to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, release into the sea was unavoidable in order to achieve Fukushima’s recovery.

 Recreation Center reopens fully amid frustrations over delays - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

The Ralph S. O’Connor Recreation Center, which underwent a large-scale renovation process over the course of the pandemic, was unveiled yesterday. The University originally announced that the project would be finished before students returned to campus for the fall, but unforeseen issues delayed the construction process. In an interview with The News-Letter, Director of Recreation and Facilities Bill Harrington explained why construction took longer than expected. “While we had hoped to open sooner, anticipated dates are subject to many variables,” he said. “In recent months, we have experienced some material and labor shortages like the rest of the world.” Despite its opening, there will be ongoing construction to complete before the facility is fully operational, Harrington noted. Students have voiced frustrations about the delays in construction. Sophomore Jayden Chiu explained that his alternative to the Rec Center has been inconvenient in several ways. “It’s been kind of annoying because I

The Ralph O’Connor Center for Recreation and Well-Being is scheduled for completion by Oct. 4 and will open at full capacity by mid-October. The University announced plans to expand the Recreation (Rec) Center in 2020. The Rec Center is currently open at limited capacity, with less than usual cardio and strength equipment, basketball courts, the bouldering cave, the climbing wall and group fitness classes available to Hopkins affiliates. No prior registration is required, nor are there density limits.

A matchmaking service recently launched on campus to mixed reviews. The Hopkins Marriage Pact claims to promote new connections between students, primarily platonic. However, students are still seeking clarity after promotional materials and the survey itself seem to emphasize sexual relationships. In fall 2017, Stanford University students Liam McGregor and Sophia Sterling-Angus created the Marriage Pact as a project for an economics class. They designed a 50-question survey meant to find the most compatible matches on campus. During its first week at Stanford, over half of the campus participated. The nonprofit took off during the pandemic and is now active at 55 schools. The service operates on the basis that college is the largest pool of similarly aged people that most will ever be in, and that many people marry their college classmates. According to the Hopkins Marriage Pact, the service has since shifted to emphasize more casual matches. Freshman

The Student Government Association (SGA) held its weekly general board meeting on Tuesday, Sept. 7 to revisit an email written by Junior Class Senator Peter Huang concerning the requirement for international students’ to receive COVID-19 vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration despite having already received vaccines approved by the World Health Organization. Huang explained that the central message of the letter is for international students to receive assurance and support from the University should things go wrong. He outlined his process for writing the letter, written with the sole intention of reflecting the voices of international students. “Most of the stuff that I wrote on this email was from two weeks ago, and they were directly coming out of the mouths from international students that have messaged me who were concerned about the new vaccination policy,” he said. “This is not scientifically cited, but it is cited from

The Hopkins Student Organization for Programming (HOP), a student-run social programming group that contributed to Spring Fair planning this year, released an online matchmaking survey on Monday, April 19 via an Instagram post. The survey was originally going to be part of the hybrid in-person Spring Fair that started on Friday, April 23. According to HOP Executive Chair Amal Hayat, the University paid $75 to Fortress Software Inc. to facilitate the survey. One question asked students to indicate their gender identity based on their “anatomical parts” and whether they preferred to be matched with someone with the same or opposite anatomical parts. Sophomore Tomisin Longe, one of the first students to directly contact the HOP about the survey, noted the harm of such questions. “An obvious issue is the fact that it’s very reductive to reduce people to their ‘anatomical parts,’” they said. “It’s also a very intrusive question to

The newly elected Student Government Association (SGA) held its first in-person meeting of the year on Tuesday, August 31 to discuss past projects and prepare for the upcoming semester. Junior Senator Chinat Yu highlighted the recent difficulties faced by international students due to school vaccination mandates requiring the taking of a vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), even if they had taken one cleared by the World Health Organization (WHO). “Our big concern is that there is no scientific proof about what happens if you have two mixed vaccine shots within a short period of time,” Yu said. Junior Senator Peter Huang had been working on an email to be sent to school officials, hoping the University would assume some responsibilities for the mixed vaccine registration if it negatively impacts students’ health. “A lot of international students come without their families. All we have is the support

The senior class council held the senior Met Gala on April 2 in commemoration of their upcoming graduation. Seniors were able to choose between two types of tickets, photo and general admission, and could purchase one ticket for their attendance. In an email to The News-Letter, Senior Class President Nathan Mudrak explained that there were 300 confirmed registrations with 25 guaranteed walk-ins. There were 26 people on the waitlist, and all walk-ins were admitted. He shared that 251 guests were checked in through Hopkins Groups, but he estimated attendance was around 275 since some guests did not check in. Mudrak was impressed by the number of seniors who registered for the event. Because of the number of students interested in attending, the council decided to negotiate its initial contract with the venue. “This allowed us to both allow all seniors who registered within the first hour to have a confirmed

The University reinstated several COVID-19 safety protocols in an email sent to undergraduate students on May 6, including updated masking and testing guidance. Undergraduate students will be required to test twice a week and masking will now be required in libraries and study areas, including Brody Learning Commons, given its increased use during finals week. Guests helping students move out of residence halls will also be required to wear masks. The email noted the uptick in cases came in the wake of student events, including the Meek Mill concert on April 30. On May 10, the campus dashboard reported that 531 students had tested positive for COVID-19 in the last seven days. Vice President for Communications Andrew Green discussed the University’s decision to expand COVID-19 protocols in an email to The News-Letter. “Given the changed circumstances, we have since reinstated required masking at large (greater than 50 people) indoor events,

As part of the campaign Stop Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Transphobia, trans students and allies have been demanding changes to certain University policies. Advocates held two protests for this cause last semester, one on Oct. 15 and the other on Nov. 18. In interviews with The News-Letter, advocates expanded on their goals for the upcoming semester. The protesters’ four demands to the University have been to allow instructors and students to display whichever name they prefer in the Student Information System (SIS), revoke former German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s honorary degree, extend graduate students’ insurance to cover “cosmetic” procedures such as facial feminization surgery and facial hair epilation and guarantee equal numbers of cisgender and transgender people on every committee that decides on trans matters.

 Hopkins Hospital: a history of sex reassignment - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By RACHEL WITKIN                                                     | May 1, 2014
Editor’s note: this article makes several misleading claims. It does not properly contextualize psychologist John Money’s forced sexual reassignment surgery of David Reimer. It also implies that sexual reassignment surgery was introduced in the 1960s, though procedures took place earlier in the 1900s. The News-Letter regrets these errors. In 1965, the Hopkins Hospital became the first academic institution in the United States to perform sex reassignment surgeries. Now also known by names like genital reconstruction surgery and sex realignment surgery, the procedures were perceived as radical and attracted attention from The New York Times and tabloids alike. But they were conducted for experimental, not political, reasons. Regardless, as the first place in the country where doctors and researchers could go to learn about sex reassignment surgery, Hopkins became the model for other institutions. But in 1979, Hopkins stopped performing the surgeries and never resumed. In the 1960s, the idea to

Hopkins affiliates gathered in front of Gilman Hall last Friday to protest the transphobia students have experienced with University policies. Leaders of the campaign outlined their demands in a letter to the administration that was circulated within the student body. At the event, members of the community shared their grievances on these issues. Luce deLire, a PhD student, organized the event in partnership with Teachers and Researchers United (TRU), an unofficial graduate student union, and the Hopkins Minorities and Philosophy chapter. DeLire opened the event by listing the demands of the letter. According to deLire, one of the prominent issues faced by the trans community at Hopkins is how its members are identified. The Student Information System (SIS) requires that students input their dead name — the birth name of someone who has since changed it — in the system if they are unable to legally change their name. “Some

Her talk, titled “History and Harm: The Unfinished Trans Story of Johns Hopkins Hospital,” explored the University’s historic relation to trans and intersex communities and how this legacy continues today. She explained that she began studying the history of Johns Hopkins Hospital for her book, Histories of the Transgender Child, which received the 2019 Lambda Literary Award for Transgender Nonfiction. “I wanted to understand how trans youth… fit into the broader history of trans medicine and the history of medicine more broadly,” she said. “I found some kinds of hints and documents that there were some trans teenagers who had been to Johns Hopkins to transition as far back as the 1960s.” The Johns Hopkins Hospital

You’ve undeniably had an unorthodox college experience: What was supposed to be the ordinary, best-four-years-of-your-life experience was turned into a demanding journey. But you have all prevailed. We hope that the past year filled with in-person courses, live performances and exploring Baltimore with friends has made up for it! Besides attending college during a pandemic, you went through midterms, finals, papers and theses this year alone and came out on top. Never again will you have to pull another Brody Learning Commons (BLC) all-nighter, try to sneak into Hopkins Cafe as an upperclassman or complain

The night before the first day of classes, my roommate asked me if I would be able to find my way around campus. Inside, I knew the answer was probably not, but out of fear of letting my nerves show, I nonchalantly told her to relax and that I “100% got this.” The next day came, and once I arrived on campus, I immediately realized that I had absolutely no idea where I was going. After asking around five similarly confused-looking freshmen and sophomores, I finally found a senior who pointed me in the right direction and arrived at my first in-person class only seven minutes late. In hindsight, I definitely should have asked for a tour from one of my friends who had been on campus last year, but my ego simply wouldn’t let me. I kept saying to myself, “I am a junior in Blue Key — there’s

My virtual beginnings and physical endings at Hopkins By ELLIE ROSE MATTOON | May 26, 2023 3:35 pm As someone who started at Hopkins in the fall of 2020, many of my “college firsts” were virtual. It’s hard to define when exactly my college experience became “normal.” It could have been in my first in-person class sophomore year or the first show I was able to perform without wearing a mask. However, at some point, Zoom chats became study sessions at friends’ apartments and asynchronous classes turned into saving a seat for your friend before a lecture. Even though my current

 Opposing Viewpoints: Hopkins should have been more transparent during the pandemic - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Just over a year ago, the University announced its sudden transition to remote instruction due to COVID-19. Anxious and confused, thousands of undergraduate students were sent home and were left questioning when they would be able to return and if the virtual learning format would work. Fast forward to today and Hopkins looks almost entirely different from pre-COVID-19 times with Zoom classes, limited in-person activities and many students living at home. Despite its reputation as a leading public health institution, the University’s response to the pandemic has not accurately reflected this title. On June 30, the University released a draft plan describing a hybrid system for the fall 2020 semester. While plans weren’t finalized, many students signed leases while others eagerly awaited their dorm assignments. After a five-week gap in communication, the University reversed its initial plan, announcing an entirely virtual semester. By giving students less than a month of

Amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the majority of Hopkins affiliates left campus and returned home. Despite courses recommencing — and with it the familiarity of homework, quizzes and midterms — current life for Hopkins students is anything but normal. The abrupt changes the country has undertaken to reduce the spread of the novel virus have had noticeable impacts on the student body, including self-isolation, relocation and general uncertainty about how the semester will move forward. In an email to The News-Letter, junior Bentley Addison said that the University’s response to the pandemic, in terms of mental health resources for undergraduates, is not sufficient. “The University has done a characteristically poor job ensuring students who need mental health services know what their options are,” he wrote. “Since leaving campus, it’s become pretty clear that ensuring students can continue to connect with counselors and psychiatrists isn’t a priority.

For years, students have called on the University to improve mental health resources at Hopkins. In light of the pandemic, for some, it has been a year of renewed struggles. For others, the pandemic has created entirely new mental health issues. In an email to The News-Letter, Matthew Torres, director of the University’s Counseling Center, described some obstacles students are currently facing. “Everyone is forced to deal with challenges related to the pandemic and its effects on college life,” he wrote. “It is important to think about the impact on students representing various identity characteristics.” He clarified that these identity characteristics can include race, sexual orientation, family income or simply being in college. According to Torres, the pandemic has served as an impetus to the University for the expansion of mental health support resources. “We have become more adept at utilizing tools for providing remote services and have been able

The Counseling Center is offering a variety of new online support groups for students during the fall semester. There are 17 new resources, including the Critical Coping Group, Pandemic Support/Discussion Space, Parenting Support Group, Racial Trauma Group and Virtual Support Group for Loved Ones of Individuals with Eating and Body Image Issues. A full listing and description of these groups can be found on the University Wellness Website. Students can join by leaving a voicemail for the Counseling Center at (410) 516-8278. All groups are offered via Zoom and open to students located anywhere in the U.S. Similarly, web-based resources are available to all students, both domestic and international, as long as their country permits access. Mental health practitioners in the Counseling Center are unable to provide treatment internationally but are available for consultation with students.

It has now been over a month since Hopkins students received an email from the administration regarding a sudden spike in confirmed COVID-19 cases on campus. In the following days, several dozen students fell ill with COVID-19, and all in-person activities were banned. That ban was lifted, but ever since the events of early February, all Hopkins students have been subject to harsher restrictions on their in-person activities, including a five-person cap on indoor gatherings of any kind. Only this week has Hopkins allowed outdoor gatherings of more than five people to resume. However, some students are granted exceptions to these rules. The Hopkins lacrosse teams, for example, have been able to begin their season in a modified in-person setting. Lacrosse games are already being played, and football practices are due to resume in-person as well. Other varsity teams have made plans to begin practicing in-person and continue pursuing their

The University’s limit on undergraduate outdoor gatherings was increased from five to 10 people on March 4. Indoor gatherings are still limited to a maximum of five people. In an email announcing the change, Provost Sunil Kumar and Vice Provost for Student Affairs Alanna Shanahan explained that the University’s COVID-19 rates have been improving. “Since the brief spike in cases at the beginning of February, we’ve seen a return to a very low number of COVID-19 cases occurring among Johns Hopkins affiliates. In addition, the number of new cases and test positivity rate have both continued to decline across Maryland over the last several weeks,” they wrote. “Based on this improving situation, we believe we can begin modest modifications of our operating guidance in a safe manner.” However, Kumar and Shanahan stressed that this change should not lead students to stop following the University’s COVID-19 guidelines. “Following our gathering limits

Molly Gahagen I always envisioned the bulk of my freshman year being spent in a small, drafty dorm room, used as a landing pad between my classes and meeting up with friends. Instead, it was spent in my childhood bedroom, hopping on and off of endless Zoom calls. The high hopes I had for my college experience flew out of the window as the pandemic brought normal life as we knew it to a halt, leaving everyone to contemplate how to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances. Determined not to write the year off as a lost cause, I made a conscious effort to integrate myself into the campus community. Attending the virtual Student Involvement Fair, with its myriad of booths, illustrated to me the vast opportunities I could take part in.

“What is your biggest fear?” “Being forgotten.” Probably a typical hot seat question, whenever this is asked of me during a late-night talk or an icebreaker game, “Being forgotten” has always been my immediate answer. I never seemed to figure out why I’m so concerned by this fear — a constant mental struggle that has even overpowered my tangible, typically “normal” phobias such as snakes, pain and darkness. Day and night, even when I do not realize it, the fear of being forgotten brews in the back of my mind, acting as a motivator for me to push myself to do more and avoid failure at all costs. Rationally I know that “being forgotten” is an inevitability. With over eight billion people on this Earth and millennia of generations past, I am ultimately just another number, another statistic in the world. My studies in Public Health, with its focus on

This academic year felt like the real beginning of the “new normal” after many false starts. During the pandemic, the paper shifted from a primarily print publication to operating online. As restrictions lessened, elements of old traditions returned. Last year’s Editors-in-Chief Leela Gebo and Laura Wadsten initiated the process of returning the paper to its normal operating status, as they brought back print magazines and welcomed masked staff back into the Gatehouse. From this foundation, we were able to hit the ground running. As soon as we were elected as Editors-in-Chief, we already had plans to revive the rich tradition of print newspapers on campus. Despite this, we acknowledged that returning to pre-pandemic operations was not feasible, and we adapted the paper in accordance with the times. Just over a month into last semester, the first print edition since March 2020 was released on campus. Doing this was not a

The return to “normal” has been gradual for all, The News-Letter included. The pandemic forced us to move our print publication, a tradition on campus for over 120 years, to a fully online, daily production with our last print edition published on March 12, 2020. Last year, we returned to the Gatehouse, our cozy office on campus, and our staff finally got to work together in person after spending a year operating remotely. As part of that transition, the paper reintroduced print magazines to campus, laying the groundwork for this year’s eventual return to print papers. We’re excited to see students and professors alike lounging in Brody Cafe or Gilman Atrium, indulging in the nostalgia of reading a print edition and conversing over the myriad articles with the vague annoyance of ink-smudged fingers. Although we’re bringing the tradition of print back to campus, we are modifying some aspects to adapt

In March 2020, COVID-19 forced us to switch to daily, online-only production. Yet for the nearly 125 years before the pandemic, The News-Letter was a print (or a print-first) publication. The oldest paper in the Sheridan Libraries archive is our Oct. 14, 1897 issue. Back then, the paper was published every other week and cost 15 cents per copy or $1.50 for a yearly subscription. Some of the articles include a lecture at the School of Medicine and a piece about the institution of a College Congress at Hopkins. COURTESY OF THE UNIVERSITY ARCHIVES — SHERIDAN LIBRARIES This was just the fifth issue of the paper and the first of the paper’s second volume. Since then, beyond adding more staff and new sections like Opinions and Leisure, we’ve fundamentally reworked the look and goals of the paper and gone online.

Our love of Swift is nothing new, as both of us are longtime fans. While we, along with every other fan, are vying for the chance to live out our wildest dreams, we know that tour tickets will likely be untouchable. On the off chance that we are not the lucky ones, we decided to attend the “I Want Your Midnights: A Taylor Swift Dance Party” at the Baltimore Soundstage on Nov. 5 to shake it off with two of our friends, Yuwen and DJ.

The stakes were high, but the rewards were higher. On Sunday, Dec. 4, the second-ranked Hopkins Blue Jays faced off against the fourth-ranked Case Western Reserve Spartans in the 2022 Division III Women's Soccer National Championships. Both teams were vying for a chance to win their first-ever national title. Judging by the title, it was the Blue Jays who ended up taking the crown as they beat the Spartans 2–1, solidifying the fact that the Jays scored at least two goals in each game out of their last 21 games. The grueling 90 minutes featured 33 combined shots, 12 combined saves and a few near-misses on both sides. The Blue Jays ended their season unbeaten with a record of 23-0-2 and winning 21 straight games, tying the school record. The Jays struck first as graduate forward Rachel Jackson and graduate middle Breukelen Woodard tag-teamed to bring Hopkins to that early

By ZACHARY BAHAR                                                     | February 6, 2023
Just more than a year after its launch, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has confirmed the existence of its first exoplanet, discovered by a team of astronomers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). The Earth-sized planet, LHS 475 b, orbits a red dwarf star approximately 41 light years from Earth in the constellation Octans. LHS 475 b was already suspected to exist based on measurements taken by NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). TESS uses single-band photometry to take large-scale images of the sky and can detect minute changes in light from stars to identify the presence of an exoplanet passing in front of its star — a process known as transiting. In an email to The News-Letter, APL Mission Area Executive for Civil Space Jason Kalirai explained the difference between previous missions, including TESS and JWST. “For transit observations, large field missions like Kepler and

As Editors-in-Chief of The Johns Hopkins News-Letter, one of our roles is to serve as the public face of the paper, which means we can often be found around campus delivering print papers, at tabling events or simply repping our News-Letter tote bags or crewnecks. It never fails to astound us when students ask, “We have a school newspaper?” We often chalk this up to the disconnect lingering on campus after the pandemic and our years of remote learning, or the student body’s temporary time here, which may leave them feeling little need to tap into the Hopkins or Baltimore community. However, this is a symptom of a larger trend in society: The majority of younger generations are often out of touch with current events. In one study, over one-fifth of young Americans reported not receiving the news daily. Age was the largest determinant of knowledge about political news in

Men’s lacrosse pulled off the upset of the year in last Saturday’s matchup against third-ranked Georgetown University Hoyas. The Blue Jays had the fourth-quarter advantage in shots on goal, ground ball and face-offs. This was a game of runs, as the Hoyas jumped out to an early 4–1 lead in the first 15 minutes of the game. The Blue Jays responded rapidly, scoring three goals in 41 seconds to cut the Hoya’s lead to 5–4. Junior attackman Russell Melendez scored shortly thereafter to tie the game. Melendez scored a career-high four goals in this game. In an interview with The News-Letter, he spoke about what the win meant for him and the team going forward. “I've been waiting for that moment for about 12 years,” he said. “It feels amazing to play well, especially in a huge game like that, but it starts with the coaches and other players opening

With a 97% majority, graduate students at Hopkins overwhelmingly voted in favor of unionization in a union representation election, facilitated by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), on Jan. 30 and 31. Organizers at Teachers and Researchers United (TRU), which is affiliated with United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), expressed their excitement regarding the results of the election and the culmination of their work. In an email to The News-Letter, Wisam Awadallah, a doctoral candidate in the School of Medicine and an organizer for TRU-UE, emphasized how other avenues of advocacy were not effective, making unionization the only way forward. “A lot of people have been working towards this for years, many graduated or left the university before they could see this happen,” he wrote. “I am looking forward towards bargaining and making sure graduate workers receive a fair contract and continue to make our voices heard.”

Teachers and Researchers United (TRU), the University’s unofficial graduate student union, held a rally on Dec. 11 to demand that Hopkins improve its treatment of graduate students. The rally, titled Uniting on Wheels, began with a car caravan through the streets surrounding Homewood Campus and ended at Homewood’s East Gate. About 30 protesters listened to graduate students Caleb Andrews and Ronay Bakan read student testimonials criticizing the University. TRU outlined four demands during the rally: a universal one-year funding extension for all PhD students; free access to the COVID-19 vaccine once it becomes available, along with proper personal protective equipment, masks and sanitizers; decision-making power in laboratory and classroom safety, especially if the University reopens for the spring semester; and official recognition as a union by Hopkins. Andrews, a third-year student in the Materials Science and Engineering Department and liaison for TRU, transferred to Hopkins shortly before the University moved

On Friday, May 22, Vice Provosts Nancy Kass and Stephen Gange abruptly ended ongoing meetings with Teachers and Researchers United (TRU), the Homewood Graduate Representative Organization, the School of Medicine Graduate Student Association and the Hopkins School of Public Health Student Assembly. These meetings had served as a forum to collectively determine how the Hopkins administration would support its graduate students during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Citing a message from TRU to the Homewood Faculty Assembly criticizing the failure of the Vice Provosts to forcefully represent graduate student interests, Kass emailed the student member of these conversations with the following message: “While we had anticipated that we would continue subsequent meetings together, we believe it would be better for you to pursue further discussions directly with the individual school graduate vice deans.” After two months of good-faith outreach on the part of TRU and elected representatives of the student body,

Teachers and Researchers United (TRU), an unofficial graduate student union, began circulating a petition against the University’s coronavirus (COVID-19) guidelines for students on Sept. 4. In the petition, TRU urges the administration to increase student involvement in the decision making process, particularly in matters that directly affect the student body. TRU acknowledges that some of the guidelines are necessary to enforce recommendations set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; however, the group argues that the University must increase its transparency and create a standardized procedure for penalizing students who violate these guidelines. “The university has once again shown that it will prioritize its institutional interests over the wellbeing of its constituents. Given the vague, coercive, and punitive nature of these guidelines, which are largely unnecessary when the entire university is operating virtually, we fear that the enforcement mechanisms behind these guidelines will allow further abuse in the post-COVID

University President Ronald J. Daniels reported on Oct. 15 that the University ended the FY20 fiscal year with a surplus of $75 million due to mitigation efforts. These efforts, which include salary and hiring freezes, will be kept in place until the end of the school year. Without austerity measures, the University had anticipated losses of $100 million from the FY20 fiscal year. Daniels added that the projected deficit for the current fiscal year has decreased from the $375 million predicted in April to $73 million. He explained that the deficit would have been twice as high if not for the University’s actions in early April. “We initiated a multiphase plan that sought to preserve the health and safety of our community; continue to deliver on our education, clinical, and research missions; and respond to the needs of our local and global communities... while also ensuring responsible financial management of

When the University implemented austerity measures at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, faculty, staff and students pushed back. In light of the recent financial report showing the University finished fiscal year 2021 with an operating budget surplus of over $212 million, these affiliates argue that the constraints proved too harsh and unwarranted. In April 2020, Hopkins estimated projected losses of $100 million in fiscal year 2020 and $375 million for fiscal year 2021. Austerity measures The University announced the imposition of austerity measures in April 2020, suspending employer retirement contributions, furloughing staff and placing restrictions on hiring. In Oct., 2020, Hopkins shared that it would not end austerity measures, despite ending fiscal year 2020 with a $74 million surplus. On Feb. 5, 2021, the University announced that hiring and merit pay increases would resume on July 1. On April 2, it announced the end of austerity measures and full

What do you call the phase of spending cuts that precedes thoughtful, deliberative planning? This was the question I was left with earlier this month, after a virtual town hall on budgetary decisions made by the University leadership in light of the coronavirus (COVID-19). I hasten to add that it was an excellent event, full of detailed information about the University’s finances and budgets. Two weeks later, Provost Sunil Kumar and Senior Vice President for Finance and Administration Daniel Ennis released additional financial information in response to an open letter to University President Ronald J. Daniels and the Board of Trustees that garnered more than 600 faculty signatures. Meanwhile, the University established an ad hoc committee that, for the first time, includes elected faculty members from across the University. These actions may herald a new era of greater transparency and collaboration in University governance. Although President Daniels’ absence from the

For the sake of Baltimore’s health and students’ safety, University President Ronald J. Daniels and the University’s leadership must work more collaboratively with faculty, students, staff and the people of Baltimore. As July gave way to August, the University was still making preparations for the return of undergraduates to Homewood Campus, despite the rising number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in Baltimore, which doubled in the first two weeks of July. As new cases continued to rise, University leadership in Garland Hall signaled heightened concern. Just a month before students were due to return to campus, administrators were scrambling to finalize arrangements for testing undergraduates; they had not made a decision about frequency of testing, and they were still trying to recruit as yet untrained staff to assist. There was no mention of required testing for faculty, staff or contract workers (optional testing was planned) — even though staff in service

Three days ago, top University officials announced that they would be halting their plans to create a private police force (JHPD) for at least two years. This was the second communication sent to the student body in response to the protests that began when George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer. It took almost an entire week after Floyd’s death for the University to release a statement. The first email Hopkins sent claimed to express solidarity with the black community, but neglected to acknowledge the University’s contributions to structural racism in Baltimore. While administrators mentioned the launch of a virtual symposium on racial justice, they notably failed to address the planned private police force. Their second email announced the delay of the implementation of JHPD for two years, but this performative gesture means little given that the University was already falling behind on its timeline.

University President Ronald J. Daniels and Johns Hopkins Medicine CEO Paul B. Rothman announced that Hopkins may create a private police department with the aim to increase public safety on and around its Baltimore campuses. They made the announcement in an email to students, faculty and staff on Monday. On the same day, a bill was introduced into the Maryland General Assembly which would authorize private universities in Baltimore City “to establish a campus police force.” Currently, private institutions do not have this authority, although several public schools in Baltimore, including Morgan State University and Coppin State University, maintain their own police departments. Students are divided over whether a campus police force would effectively increase safety at Hopkins and in its neighboring communities. In an email to The News-Letter, Vice President for Communications Susan Ridge explained why Hopkins supports this bill. “The importance of establishing a University police department is

Hopkins suspended employer retirement contributions a year ago as part of its austerity measures to offset financial challenges due to COVID-19. On April 2, the University announced the full restoration of these benefits, as well as $10 million in research funding for faculty and $5 million for PhD students. The University originally announced last fall that austerity measures, including furloughs and hiring freezes, would remain in place until the end of the 2020-21 academic year. However, administrators shared on Feb. 5 that hiring and employee pay increases will resume July 1. Faculty and staff will also now receive retroactive retirement contributions from July to December 2020 instead of just January to March 2021, as previously announced. Alexander Parry, a member of the organizing committee of Teachers and Researchers United (TRU), an unofficial graduate student union, described this decision as a step in the right direction. “While we’re glad that the

Teachers and Researchers United (TRU), an unofficial graduate student union, held a socially distanced protest in the form of a satirical awards show on March 10 at the Beach to mark the one-year anniversary of the University’s COVID-19 shutdown. At the protest, called the “Covies,” TRU accused the University’s leadership of failing to protect and support graduate students. The event came after TRU held a rally and caravan last December and sent numerous petitions to the University seeking funding extensions and additional health-care support. Different graduate students swapped off to announce categories, nominations and winners of each award. Some categories included “Most Ineffective COVID Reporting System” and “Vaguest Promise for Graduate Workers.” “Prodensity” and “Making it all department-specific so we don’t know what’s going on” won these awards, respectively.

“Every University administrator knows that graduate students do the vast majority of the work that gives the University its status and accolades in research. To President Daniels, I would say that the fact that admin isn’t willing to do the bare minimum to support its graduate students and make sure they can be healthy and safe during a global pandemic is appalling. It is unfair and cruel to the point where I would not recommend that prospective graduate students come to Johns Hopkins.” These are the words of Celia Litovsky, a sixth-year PhD student in the Department of Cognitive Science. She has been struggling to make ends meet because delays in her research depleted her fellowship money.

Graduate students across three Hopkins campuses voted in a union representation election, facilitated by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), on Jan. 30 and 31. The election was organized by Teachers and Researchers United (TRU), which is affiliated with United Electrical Radio, and Machine Workers (UE). The vote overwhelmingly favored unionization — out of 3,335 NLRB-registered voters, 2,053 voted yes and 67 voted no, resulting in a 97% majority and 64% turnout rate. According to TRU-UE, the majority of graduate students signed cards calling for an election, with over 2,000 cards submitted to the NLRB in total. The two-day election took place in Homewood, East Baltimore and Washington, D.C. campuses.

The Teachers and Researchers United (TRU), an unofficial graduate student union, held a rally for fair wages in Keyser Quad on Oct. 25. Affiliated with United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), TRU kicked off the process to be formally recognized as a union by the University by hosting a union card drive. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) states that after 30% of employees submit a union card, the organization can file a petition for a union election to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The election requires a simple majority to vote for a union, and after this the union must be recognized by the University. Additionally, the University can also choose to recognize TRU as a union based on evidence at any time. In an interview with The News-Letter, Peter Weck, a doctoral student in the Physics and Astronomy department, detailed that TRU first organized

On the evening of March 3, the Hopkins Symphony Orchestra (HSO) gave a concert titled “The Maestro,” celebrating the 30th anniversary of Music Director and Conductor Jed Gaylin. They played pieces by Mozart, Amanda Harberg and Manuel de Falla. In an unusual departure from most HSO concerts, Gaylin was not only the conductor but also the soloist for this performance. The concert began with Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 2, where Gaylin conducted from the piano bench where he performed as the soloist. As the orchestra began to play, Gaylin conducted with his arms flourishing, raised high above his head. Ostensibly, this was so that the orchestra could see his movements despite him not being up on a podium. Yet I couldn’t help but feel as if these raised gestures were exaltation in movement, expressing joy in every beat. The concerto had a wonderfully bright, easy and playful sound which brought

The Bloomberg Center for Physics and Astronomy hosted “Music and Astronomy: New Music for Voice Inspired by Space” on March 4, which featured original compositions and vocal performances by Peabody Institute students. The event, free and open to the public, was a collaboration between the Peabody Department of Composition and the Department of Physics and Astronomy, bridging the two different campuses for an evening of interdisciplinary exploration. Each composer drew inspiration from an image of deep space, which were curated by Physics and Astronomy Professor Brice Ménard. Some of the images were taken by the James Webb Space Telescope, operated right across the street from the Bloomberg Center. The composers also looked at the NASA descriptions for each photo and found unique ways to incorporate the text in their work.

Last month, the James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) launched from French Guiana, and after a long journey, the telescope reached its final destination yesterday afternoon. While Webb is a global effort involving tens of thousands of scientists and engineers and billions of dollars, its heart is right in our backyard. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) serves as the science and operations center for Webb, in addition to the Hubble Space Telescope and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. The Hubble telescope measures wavelengths of light between 0.1 to 2.5 microns, observing the ultraviolet and violet ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum as well as a portion of the infrared range. In contrast, Webb is almost exclusively an infrared telescope, focused on wavelengths from 0.6 to 28 microns. Additionally, Webb’s primary mirror — 18 hexagonal segments of gold-coated beryllium — possesses a 6.6-meter diameter, a 275% increase compared to Hubble’s 2.4-meter

Faculty members from the Center for Africana Studies (CAS) plan to submit a proposal to the University requesting the departmentalization of Africana Studies. If accepted, the new department will have the ability to hire faculty members independently and support doctoral degrees in Africana Studies. In an interview with The News-Letter, Associate Professor and Director of the Center for Africana Studies Minkah Makalani described how Africana Studies at Hopkins compares to Africana Studies at other universities. “[Africana studies at Hopkins] is woefully behind,” he said. “In terms of the gathering of faculty at Hopkins who are tied to Africana Studies, we measure up to our peer institutions. In terms of as an institution in itself, being a center as opposed to a department, having very limited office space... we’re light years behind our peers.” Many of the University’s peer institutions, including Georgetown, Temple, Harvard, Yale, Columbia and Brown, support Africana Studies

 IDEAL hosts student-led discussion about the JHPD - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

The University’s IDEAL chapter hosted a discussion titled “The Johns Hopkins Police Department: It’s Approval and Consequences” on Nov 30. The seminar provided students with the opportunity to address their concerns about the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD) and public safety with fellow students. IDEAL, which stands for Inform, Discuss, Enlighten, Acknowledge and Learn, is a nonpartisan nonprofit that seeks to change the way students think about politics and interact with each other. The event began with junior Jake Szeszko establishing the discussion’s main goals. “The goal of this discussion is to work together towards a consensus,” he said. “We’re not trying to decide whether JHPD is necessarily right or wrong. We’re just trying to figure out how it can be improved in the first place, how it’s going to be implemented and what might result because of that.” Szeszko outlined a few common justifications of the JHPD prior to

The University announced plans to hire 13 new faculty members in three areas of study as part of the Fannie Gaston-Johansson Faculty of Excellence Program (FGJFEP) on Nov. 16. Named after the University’s first Black woman to become a tenured professor at Hopkins, Fannie Gaston-Johansson, the FGJFEP has resulted in the recruitment of 35 tenure-track professors over a six-year period. The program is part of the Faculty Diversity Initiative (FDI), recently revived under the University’s Second Roadmap on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. From nine submitted proposals, the FDJFEP Selection Committee, President Ronald Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar selected three areas of interdisciplinary study to receive faculty hires: Mathematical Biology, Fluid Mechanics across scales and the Center for Africana Studies. A second call for proposals is planned for later in the academic year, with a March 1 application deadline. Associate Vice Provost for Faculty Diversity Roland Thorpe explained the selection committee’s

When I was younger, I was always known as someone with a “quiet voice.” I tended to be shy and let others speak for me, preferring to hang in the background and let my achievements shine through. However, this was not an attribute that I particularly liked about myself. I strove to break through those bounds and find other avenues to make my voice heard as I entered high school. I joined debate, the school newspaper and took on leadership roles to force myself out of my comfort zone and get used to public speaking. Then, I came to Hopkins and continued to seek opportunities to do so. Among all these experiences, I don’t think I truly found my “voice” until I joined The News-Letter at Hopkins. I’ve always preferred structure — something that has pulled me toward journalism and away from creative writing. I preferred to use my writing

Even before the pandemic hit, staying at home everyday always left me feeling restless. I am the type of person who needs to be out and about doing something productive, whether it’s finishing errands, meeting with friends or simply walking in the park. So, aware that I would be spending countless monotonous days at home in this new normal, I knew I had to redirect my energy somewhere else. That’s why I turned to working out and learning yoga. Aside from some research, nonprofit and internship work, I have spent the majority of my time in quarantine exercising, usually seven times a week if my body can handle it. It isn’t as if I haven’t exercised before. In fact, I would say that I exercised pretty consistently even before quarantine; however, I didn't have a regimen in place, and studies and extracurriculars would often get in the way of making

I will shamelessly admit that I am one of those people whose camera roll and Instagram stories are filled with sunset photos. The beautiful blend of warm and cool palettes against the city landscape never fails to give me a sense of peace and a reminder of how beautiful the Earth can be, especially after being stuck inside for so long. Sunsets usually signify the end of a long, tiring day and a time for a bit of rest. Recently for me though, sunsets merely indicate the beginning of a long and arduous night filled with watching lectures, studying and attending club meetings. Instead of waking up to a soft ray of sunlight with birds chirping, I wake up to the harsh afternoon sun as cars noisily race through the city streets. I get up, eat a little snack and head straight to do my daily workout routine (thank God

I still remember the whispers of a novel disease and the potential onset of a pandemic that crept through the quads of Hopkins a year ago. Among them was the speculation that all of us students might be sent home, which gradually became more likely as other universities announced that they were closing. Safe in the Hopkins bubble, however, I remained in denial as to how bad the situation was getting. All of the news seemed to belong to some parallel dystopian universe that could only be found in books. None of us could have ever imagined the massive anguish and suffering that the virus would bring on a global level. Then the news came — I remember it as clear as day on March 10, 2020. At a time when masks still weren’t the norm, my friends and I were having dinner at Nolan’s, debating whether Hopkins would actually

August 16: the day I finally returned to Hopkins after the pandemic unpredictably stole a year from many college students. As I sat in the rental car with my parents and drove down the oh-so-familiar N. Charles Street, memories from freshman year flooded my mind, and I couldn’t help but feel teary-eyed at the sentiments from the past. Back then, my last memory of campus was hanging out on the Beach at 4 a.m. before calling an Uber from Wolman Hall to catch my flight for spring break, leaving without any idea of when we would return. I had been dreaming of resuming the college experience for so long, and it felt surreal to even be back at Hopkins after being away for over a year. Passing the Gatehouse, seeing the destruction of Mattin and catching a glimpse of the Beach before arriving at Nine East filled my heart with

Just like that, another year at Hopkins has come to a close. Recently one of my friends asked me the following question: “How would you rate your college experience so far?” This question immediately made me reflect on how I felt during freshman year when I was still apprehensive about whether I had made the right decision of coming to Hopkins. Even if coronavirus (COVID-19) disrupted my entire sophomore year, I can confidently say now that I have found my place at Hopkins and am grateful for all that I have gained here as a junior. From leading our first general meetings at the Gatehouse to dance rehearsals for our first Barrio Fiesta and Eclectics showcase to exploring Baltimore further beyond Hopkins, this year has been one of many firsts — even as a junior. It seems like August was just yesterday. I remember driving down N. Charles Street in

It always feels like one of those crossover episodes when my friends in college meet my friends from high school. The friendships, though all very special to me, still feel somewhat unique and separate from one another since they represent very different parts of my life. Over Spring Break I met up with a friend from back home, Katie, in New York. After spending a few days in an Airbnb with Hopkins friends, my weekend getaway culminated in a day trip to the Big Apple. My friend and I had planned to meet there after a serendipitous alignment of events brought her to the city for her study-abroad semester. Before this, we had only been able to meet in person once in the past three years, since we began our college careers in different countries. Prior to Spring Break, the last time I had seen any of my high school

At the beginning of my summer, this is what I had attributed my opportunity to live and intern in California to — luck. My experiences over the past summer were never something that I had considered for my personal plan nor were they a possibility that I thought could be on my radar. But when I received the call from my recruiter during spring break, I knew it was something that I had to take. But still, my constant worries about the future did not end there. Once I had secured my dream summer internship, my mind immediately began to ruminate on the next big thing. Would I succeed at my work? Would I fit into the company culture? Would I be able to live on my own? Is this the right place for me? And as my start date drew closer and my plane landed in California, I was

However, beneath this image, Hopkins is also an institution that has historically mistreated the communities of color that surround it. Most of us are familiar with the ways in which the University has failed Black Baltimoreans. In 1951, Hopkins Hospital took samples of Henrietta Lacks’ cells without her consent, paving the way for later advances in medicine, yet at the cost of exploiting a Black patient.

“What happened to me has elements of both a sexual crime — it’s inhibiting my reproductive rights — and elements of a racist crime — I feel I was targeted because I suffer from a genetic condition that predominantly affects African Americans.” These are the words of Zacharie Liman-Tinguiri, who was nine months old when he was first diagnosed with sickle cell disease. In 2015, as an adult, he was admitted to a clinical trial led by Dr. Javier Bolaños-Meade at Hopkins Hospital with hopes of being cured. The treatment, however, did not end as he expected. In August of 2017, Liman-Tinguiri was diagnosed with primary testicular failure. Although he was cured of sickle cell, Liman-Tinguiri believes that he was intentionally sterilized in the process.

The myth of Johns Hopkins, the University’s namesake and founder, has been proudly retold countless times on campus tours, convocations and around Baltimore: He was a lifelong abolitionist whose father, an avowed Quaker, freed the family’s enslaved people in 1807. According to the story, Hopkins eventually became a successful businessman in Baltimore and an abolitionist who supported President Abraham Lincoln and the Union. On his death in 1873, he left $7 million — the largest philanthropic bequest in U.S. history at that time — to found what became the nation’s first research university, as well as a hospital that famously served Baltimoreans “without regard to sex, age or color.” Last spring, however, a team of researchers led by Martha Jones began researching a 1850 census record listing four enslaved people in the household of a man named Johns Hopkins.

In an effort to reconnect the Hopkins community to its shared history and traditions, the Office of the President launched Hopkins Retrospective, a project that includes several initiatives intended to make the University’s history more widely accessible. The Retrospective sheds light on many aspects of the University, including its breakthroughs in scientific research, its central role in the development of modern research institutions in the United States and its long list of distinguished alumni. However, this project also exposes the University’s struggles, which include lapses in funding and an ongoing need to develop organizational synchronization between the various schools and departments throughout the University system. The Retrospective project spans across all Hopkins campuses, including Homewood, the Peabody Institute and the medical campuses in and around Baltimore.

The Homewood Museum hosted the latest event in the Architectural Lecture Series last Monday evening with a talk about the history of slave life on the Homewood Estate. The talk was part of an initiative by the museum to bring awareness to the stories of enslaved people on the land now occupied by Homewood campus. Abby Schreiber, a lecturer at the College of William and Mary, discussed the spaces slaves inhabited and how they made a life for themselves. “There’s a lot of difficult history here,” Schrieber said. “One way that we can deal with that is to learn more about it and understand more how it affected the people who were enslaved at Homewood.” In the early 19th century, this land was owned by Charles Carroll II, whose father was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.

Anne Rubin, a history professor at the University of Baltimore, gave a lecture on early Baltimore at an event titled “Free Streets/Slave Streets: Visualizing the Landscape in Early Baltimore” on Feb. 6 at the Homewood Museum. During her presentation, Rubin used interactive maps to juxtapose the lives of enslaved and free blacks in the city. Rubin studies Civil War history and has earned acclaim for her work with digital archives. Deyane Moses, a student at MICA who wants to become an archivist, also attended the event. She noted the attention to detail in Rubin’s presentation. “I was really intrigued by their mapping and their concern for African Americans -- free blacks and not-so-free blacks,” she said. “They’ve done an impressive amount of work.” The event is meant to complement a revamped version of the traditional Homewood Museum tour that is titled “Families at Homewood.” The revamped tour follows the lives

The Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) screened a video lecture honoring Henrietta Lacks and the impact of her cells titled “Henrietta Lacks Memorial Lecture: 100 years of Henrietta Lacks” on Saturday, Oct. 24. The event addressed the widespread reach and complexity of Lacks and her cells, both biomedically and ethically, and aimed to provide insight into the past, present and future of clinical research conduct. Henrietta Lacks was a Black patient at the Hopkins Hospital who died of cervical cancer in 1951. While diagnosing and treating her disease, the Hospital took samples of her cancerous cells without her knowledge or consent. Lacks’ cells were unique because, instead of dying quickly like other cells, they continued to reproduce, making them “immortal.” This allowed researchers to use her cells — dubbed HeLa cells — to pave the way for advances in modern medicine. The year 2020 marks what would have

Improving the Black pre-med experience at Hopkins and nationwide By TRISHA PARAYIL | May 3, 2021 12:00 pm “As Black students begin the daunting process of applying to medical school, the structural racism and inequality that they experience is not always visible to the public,” Shavonia Wynn wrote in an email to The News-Letter. Wynn is the director of Johns Hopkins Underrepresented in Medical Professions (JUMP), a program that was established in 2011 to support students from racial and ethnic minorities and first-generation, including first-generated and limited income students, who are pursuing health careers.

When the news emerged, freshman Cierra Gladden told The News-Letter that she had always believed that Hopkins had enslaved Black people. “There was never space in my mind for hope that the origins of this institution weren’t racist. We know that these older institutions were built by slaves or on the backs of them, and they aren’t made

Activists have fought against the University’s aggressive medical debt collection tactics for years. As recently as last month, End Medical Debt Maryland hosted a rally to advocate for the Medical Debt Protection Act, which passed in this year’s Maryland General Assembly.

By KATY WILNER and LEELA GEBO | May 3, 2021 12:00 pm The U.S. government classifies most colleges and universities as nonprofits because of their “educational purposes,” exempting them from federal income taxes. This means that, despite operating four campuses in Baltimore, Hopkins is not legally required to pay the city any property taxes. In 2016, Baltimore City entered into a 10-year Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) agreement with “anchor institutions,” whereby these institutions were required to pay the city a collective $60 million over the course of 10 years.

Every day, the weather was warm, the air was humid and the sun was bright. Fall was no different, distinguished from the rest of the year only as being the second half of hurricane season and the tail end of the wet season.

The answer seems obvious when we place fall in context with the other seasons. It comes after the bright and warm vitality of summer, and it precedes the barren wasteland of winter. Naturally, we call that process of going from life to death “dying”. Thus, we could think of fall as a melancholic season of endings.

It is the soothing nook — a gentle space of transition — between Baltimore’s sweltering summers and its icy winters. There is also a hint of nostalgia that wafts in the air as leaves trade vibrant greens for amber hues before the doffing of their luxuriant manes; every falling leaf marks a yellowed page in the book of time.

The Johns Hopkins News-Letter JOY Home (current) Connection Reflection Relaxation Back to The News-Letter JOY To our fellow Hopkins Zoomers,2020 has been rough. A few months into the academic year, classes went online, students left campus and the year spiraled from there. Rather than dwell on the many low points of this year though, we asked our writers and editors to search for the things that have brought them JOY recently. For many, joy has been elusive, or even nonexistent at times, which is why we’ve chosen to gather it in this magazine. Here you’ll find it in many forms: in music, in food, in childhood memories, in small moments of day-to-day life. We hope that when you read these articles, they will also spark joy (hello Marie Kondo) for at least a few moments. If we haven’t inspired you to pick up a new hobby, return to an old

 Finding joy in the unfamiliar - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By ELIZA ZIMMERMAN                                                     | November 17, 2020
My instinctual idea of joy mimics the physicality of the word itself: a short burst, a dynamic syllable emerging from the mundane sentence around it, full of energy and brief color like a small dancer lifting her head and jumping in the air for pure love of movement. It’s akin to ecstasy, to giddy happiness. I find this version of joy in moments that overtake me, when it feels like everything is falling into place, like I’ve finally found my nook in the tableau of my life. Some examples: leaning out a car window during my senior year of high school blasting Elton John while the sun set, crowding with my coworkers on a boat after a shift to watch the stars, standing in the pulsing light of a concert, knowing every word. In all these moments, I can picture myself from the outside, a romanticized character in the movie

I’m going to be honest, when I heard the fall magazine was going to center on the theme of joy, I didn’t think I’d have an article to write. Being a Hopkins student is stressful enough at the best of times, let alone during the chaos that has been 2020. I’ve been all kinds of overwhelmed, and I’m not alone; according to a survey conducted by the University of Chicago, American happiness is the lowest it has been in 50 years. You’re probably wondering why I’m starting this article about finding joy with a pretty somber tone, but this is simply realistic. I won’t lie and say, ‘I’m fine,’ or lie and tell you everything is going to be fine — frankly, the foreseeable future doesn’t look too “fine.” However, having struggled A LOT to keep my sanity and a (reasonably) positive mindset these past few months, forcing myself to

I initially had a bit of trouble trying to think of a concept or action that really resembles joy — especially during this quarantine period, it’s much easier to fall back to negative emotions and feelings. Eventually, I realized that what got me through these past nine months and brought joy into my life while I was physically isolated were the interactions I had with my friends online. Sounds pretty simple, right? In retrospect, it was actually really hard to even make the effort to reach out to my loved ones and spend meaningful time with them when my mind was also cluttered with intrusive thoughts about the many “what-ifs.” I was worried about my immediate family and COVID-19 infection, periods of job insecurity, my extended family in Puerto Rico and Colombia who are undoubtedly facing a similar and yet fundamentally different experience to me. It was easy to send

 Pressing pause and prioritizing happiness - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By RIA ARORA                                                     | November 17, 2020
For as long as I can remember, I have always loved to sing — when nobody’s around, that is. I frequently host late-night karaoke parties for one, wail in the shower like nobody hears me and hum in the kitchen when I’m alone. Music has always been my coping mechanism for dealing with stressful events; as a child, I found myself gravitating to the piano when I felt like no one understood me, but I always hid my singing until I knew I was alone in the house. I’m pretty sure my family knew, but for my sake they acted none the wiser. Over the years, I found several excuses to not pursue vocal lessons. On the surface, I justified this by affirming that sticking with piano was the right decision; I’d already invested seven years into training, and I couldn’t pursue both piano and vocal lessons. It didn’t help

In my freshman year at Hopkins, I did my first service project through Baltimore First. Every other week I would visit Carmine Gardens, tend to the crops and maintain the landscape for sustainable growth. I befriended Hopkins alumni who taught me about the value of civic engagement and working with the community. I also learned how to use gardening tools to shape the land and how to design a sustainable and affordable community garden. Whether it was a blazing hot or freezing cold day in Baltimore, I found the utmost joy working in the community garden with the surrounding neighbors and residents of the city. In fact, one of my favorite memories is spending a quiet, sunny day stringing lines to encourage the peas to grow while talking to community neighbors about how their day was going and our shared passion for gardening. After freshman year, I started to participate

It’s impossible to nail down the exact percentage of memories I have that are explicitly tied to music. In fact, it might be necessary to add a qualifier in order to get closer to a more concrete answer. If I adjust the question to ask, “What percentage of my happy memories are tied to music?”, it becomes easier to figure out a precise number. That number exists in the 90 to 95% range. In the bustling interchange of memory encoding and storage, many of the positive memories I have are attached to some sound or song. This is because memories, like feelings or people, are fleeting. It is in their nature to be brief, as our brain attempts to hold onto them like sand slipping through our fingers. Any memory that we are lucky enough to capture and lock into our minds is either a powerful event that becomes a

Coming back home on March 12 was a very surreal, and ultimately very boring, experience. The final three days of school that were supposed to launch us into spring break were instead filled with long hours where I spent more time on YouTube and Hulu than should be legal. As my eyes glazed over during my 200th consecutive episode of Chopped, I knew there had to be something more to this life of captivity than met the eye. Then I began the chefsta (shorthand for chef Instagram, of course). In my past life, there’s no doubt in my mind that I was a chef. When I was growing up, my basement was filled with plastic foods for my little wooden kitchen. I ran a very tight ship at my fake restaurant with my sisters, often to the point of irritation for them. Even my favorite Barbie had her own cooking

“We decorated our Club Penguin house for Halloween. Y’all should see it.” The above quote would not be out of place in 2006. Those were the good old days — back when Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zack & Cody dominated the airwaves of Disney Channel, when headbands, North Face jackets and Crocs studded with Jibbitz were the height of fashion and when snack time was only complete with a pack of Fruit Gushers or Dunkaroos.

A student achieves a major academic success, a young couple buys their dream home, a retiree escapes to a tropical haven. Each person feels elated, incandescently happy. Then a phenomenon called hedonic adaptation takes hold, and the wonderful feeling subsides over time. According to David Mercier, a Hopkins adjunct faculty member, happiness is not simply a temporary pleasurable stimulation of the senses. Mercier, along with fellow Hopkins adjunct faculty member and nutritionist Kelly Dorfman, has taught an Intersession course at Hopkins titled The Art and Science of Happiness since 2018. During this class Mercier and Dorfman ask their students to not see happiness as a transient state. As we develop emotionally, psychologically and spiritually, we acquire wisdom and maturity. In an interview with The News-Letter, they explained that, as a consequence of this development, we begin to orient ourselves toward happiness. “We want to redefine the definition of happiness to

It's a warm nostalgia trip that I think everyone experiences just a little bit.

From the day she was born, she was stuck with joy being a part of her life whether she wanted it to be or not.

While science uses facts and data to conduct experiments for the purpose of explaining the paradigms of the world, love is a feeling that is unpredictable and unique to each person experiencing it. Never mind the scientists who try to attribute love solely to a series of biochemical reactions in our brains — we know that that isn’t all there is to love. The 36 questions, however, are an idea that brings both science and love together. The 36 questions are a set of questions (surprise, surprise) designed by psychologist

A serotonin-seeking coffee addict's review of Starbucks' fall drinks By EUNICE PARK | November 17, 2020 12:00 pm In the midst of a global pandemic, it’s important to find and appreciate the little sources of joy in our lives. And not only that, but the cozy fall season usually calls for one thing: Pumpkin-inspired coffee. If you’re a regular coffee drinker, then you know exactly what I mean when I say that a hot (or cold!) cup of joe can make or break a day. However, my unadulterated love for coffee doesn’t stem from just a random figment of my imagination.

The final three days of school that were supposed to launch us into spring break were instead filled with long hours where I spent more time on YouTube and Hulu than should be legal. As my eyes glazed over during my 200th consecutive episode of Chopped, I knew there had to be something more to this life of captivity than met the eye.

Looking forward to the little things By KATY WILNER | November 17, 2020 12:00 pm I used to do guided meditations almost every day. Square breathing — breathing in for the count of four, holding for the count of four, exhaling for the count of four, holding for the count of four, repeat — became second nature. Before the pandemic, I found that the majority of my stress and subsequent sadness stemmed from schoolwork, deadlines, job searching and interpersonal conflicts.

Having already seen the series and loved it myself, I started rewatching it with them as they watched it for the first time. It was during this rewatch that I fell even more in love with the show and realized that it was the perfect antidote to all of the chaos happening in the world right now. If you haven’t seen it, Schitt’s Creek is a Canadian comedy series created by father-son duo Eugene and Daniel Levy about the wealthy Rose family — Johnny (Eugene Levy), Moira (Catherine O’Hara) and their adult children David (Daniel Levy) and Alexis (Annie Murphy).

What ends up happening most days is that I spend hours in my bedroom, alternating between lying on the floor or sitting hunched over my desk, and either procrastinate by going on YouTube or half-heartedly read assigned texts.

The leader of the white supremacist National Policy Institute describes the alt-right movement as one that rejects egalitarianism and advocates for the preservation of traditional Western civilization along with a return to libertarian-style governance. While its origins in the U.S. can be traced back to the 1964 presidential nomination of Barry Goldwater, this distinct strain of conservative thought has deeper historical roots within smaller fringe groups.

You’ll be talking to a peer in one of your classes, and they’ll ask, “What are you thinking of majoring in?” You’ll be attending a virtual trivia or movie night and someone will say, “Tell me about yourself.” Surely, your First-Year Mentor (FYM) may have asked you, “What’s a random fact about you?” I should know — it’s something I asked my mentees during our first meeting. Speaking from my own experience, having these introductory conversations as a first-year student can feel crucial. I

By MICHELLE LIMPE | August 30, 2020 9:21 pm Once you proclaimed yourself to be #JHUClassof2024, you undoubtedly received questions of “Oh, are you pre-med?” and “Which science are you majoring in?” While many of you may be coming to Hopkins with a STEM-oriented plan in mind — I was no exception — I want to remind you to keep your options open. There are many interesting choices on the course catalog, including East Asian Studies, Writing Seminars and Biophysics, that are worth exploring as well. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not here to dissuade all you future Blue Jays from majoring in a STEM field. That would be quite hypocritical of me.

With the semester coming to a close, freshmen reflect on how the rollback of the University’s covered grade policy has affected their first few months at Hopkins, and upperclassmen look back on how covered grades shaped their college experience. In May of 2016, the University announced that it would rescind covered grades starting with the Class of 2021. Under this policy, previous freshmen could view their first semester grades, but they were neither shown on official transcripts nor factored into a student’s GPA. Instead, each course was shown to have been completed as satisfactory (S) for a C minus and above or unsatisfactory (U) for below a C minus. In 2008, the Homewood Academic Council (HAC) created a subcommittee to evaluate the University’s grading system. This subcommittee submitted a report to HAC in 2011, prompting HAC to vote to repeal the covered grades policy. The announcement to end this policy

A group of graduate students in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences are rallying to protest the implementation of a plan that will introduce major changes to the graduate program. The school’s Strategic Planning Final Report was released on Nov. 11 to graduate students, who responded with a comprehensive Strategic Plan Response. Signed by 261 graduate students as of press time, the response asks the administration to halt any progress on the plan until the students are able to provide their input. They have found issue with the proposed cut backs of graduate students by up to 25 percent, decreased hiring of tenured professors and fewer faculty-taught graduate classes, amongst other things. “This is a period in which higher education is under a lot of financial strain and the question of how best to use the resources we have is a very serious one that involves significant trade offs.

Following a six-month-long review of the Humanities Center (HC), Dean of the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Beverly Wendland announced that the University will not close the department. This announcement came after a neutral committee headed by Sheridan Dean of University Libraries and Museums Winston Tabb submitted a report that outlined three potential paths forward for the department. Director of the HC Hent de Vries, along with several graduate students and other faculty who led the fight against the potential closure, released a statement praising the decision. They thanked those who have defended the department over the past months. But while they appreciated the neutral committee’s efforts, several HC graduate students have also voiced concern and said that the decision should be treated cautiously. The report includes several suggestions for the future of the HC, three options for moving forward and background on the controversy of the preceding months,

Editor’s Note: This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available. #JHToo, a coalition of student activists organizing against sexual violence at Hopkins, started a letter-writing campaign on Monday to pressure administrators to revoke Anthropology Professor Juan Obarrio’s tenure. In May 2018 Obarrio was accused of sexually assaulting a visiting graduate student. The Baltimore chapter of the International Socialist Organization (ISO) and Teachers and Researchers United (TRU), a graduate student union, are collaborating with #JHToo to promote the campaign. #JHToo, ISO Baltimore and TRU explained on the campaign website why they have decided to solicit letters from the public. “The Dean’s Office at the Johns Hopkins School of Arts and Sciences has determined that Professor Juan Obarrio committed physical assault and violated the school’s sexual misconduct policy,” the page reads. “The Homewood campus Academic Council [HAC] is currently determining sanctions — they are projected to

Hopkins Medicine Senior Director of Public Relations and Corporate Communications Kim Hoppe announced in an email to The News-Letter on Wednesday that the University would not be renewing its contracts with the U.S. Department of Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE). “After careful and deliberate consideration, the JHU Center for Law Enforcement Medicine will not be renewing this contract,” Hoppe wrote. “We notified the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of Investigations (OI) several weeks ago and are currently negotiating a transition period that will allow for a safe and orderly wrap up of the medical programs.” The administration claimed that the decision was made several weeks ago yet declined to provide an exact date.

While en route to classes on Wyman and Keyser Quads on Monday, students encountered a human barrier on the Breezeway. Carefully weaving through bodies that were strewn along sidewalks and staircases, members of the community witnessed a protest organized by the Hopkins Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) meant to portray daily life in Gaza. Roughly 30 participants, clad in black attire, laid motionless on the ground for more than 15 minutes as hundreds of people stepped over their bodies. Several others carried signs urging bystanders to stand “In Solidarity with Gaza,” to “Choose Justice, Choose Peace” and to “Break the Siege on Gaza.” As onlookers slowed to determine the premise of the protest, SJP members distributed flyers that featured statistics on the Palestinian casualties of Israel’s Operation Protective Edge, which took effect this past summer in response to the kidnapping of three Israeli students in the West Bank. “2,100

 Students walk out; Dershowitz stands ground - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

By KELSEY KO and ROLLIN HU For The News-Letter Alan Dershowitz, a retired Harvard Law professor, writer and political commentator, spoke at the Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium (MSE) on Tuesday in Shriver Hall. He came despite controversy and protest leading up to his arrival on campus. His presence was protested by Hopkins Feminists and Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). Both groups staged independent walkouts during the discussion. Dershowitz is often said to be one of the nation’s best criminal defense lawyers and has defended numerous high-profile clients, such as O.J. Simpson and Mike Tyson. In addition, he is the author of The Case for Israel which was on the New York Times bestseller list. Dershowitz spoke with Visiting Professor of Political Science Robert Freedman about the Arab-Israeli conflict. Dershowitz believes that there will eventually be peace in the Middle East between Israel and the Palestinians. He said it is

The push for greener universities By MOLLY GAHAGEN | April 27, 2023 12:00 pm Divestment has been a demand leveraged by student activists to fight several social issues, including apartheid in South Africa and the unethical practices of tobacco manufacturers. For a little over a decade, student activists have found a new cause around which to mobilize and demand divestment: climate change. The fossil fuel divestment movement, which primarily calls for universities to remove their endowments’ investments in gas, coal and oil companies, began on U.S. college campuses in 2011 with Swarthmore College. Since then, over 100 U.S. colleges and universities have divested, ranging from public institutions like the

Refuel Our Future, a student activist group calling for the University to divest from fossil fuels, staged a four-hour peaceful sit-in at Garland Hall last Friday, April 21. For the past six years, Refuel has been pressuring the University to stop investing parts of the endowment in fossil fuel companies. As a follow up to the JHU Forum on Divestment from Fossil Fuels, which took place on April 17, Refuel hoped the sit-in would build momentum and place pressure on the University and the Public Interest Investment Advisory Committee (PIIAC), which will make a recommendation to the Board of Trustees. Refuel called on the University and PIIAC to make a decision on their fossil fuel divestment proposal before the end of the academic year. Senior Maggie Weese, the president of Refuel, stressed the importance of pushing the University for a timely response. “We think now is an important time to

The Public Interest Investment Advisory Committee (PIIAC) recommended that the University divest its endowment from fossil fuels in a report released on Friday. The University’s Board of Trustees commissioned PIIAC to recommend where Hopkins should invest its endowment. Made up of 13 individuals from across the University’s divisions, PIIAC includes undergraduates, graduate students, faculty and staff. In 1978, PIIAC recommended that Hopkins divest from South African corporations to protest apartheid, and in 1990 the committee called for divesting from tobacco companies. The Hopkins student group, Refuel Our Future (Refuel), spent the past six years pressuring the University to divest from fossil fuels. They submitted their divestment proposal to PIIAC in 2015. Senior Atlas Elawad, the president of Refuel, said that the organization was pleased with the report. “I want to applaud PIIAC for their recommendation,” he said. “It symbolizes leadership, forward thinking and responsibility.

Student activists around the country participated in Fossil Fuel Divestment Day (F2D2) on Thursday, Feb. 13. Refuel Our Future (Refuel), an environmental activist group on campus, hosted the event on Keyser Quad. F2D2 is part of a national movement created by Divest Ed, a training and strategy hub. Freshman Haadiya Ahmed explained that she came out to support F2D2 because it is, she believes, one of the best ways for young people to protest the negative effects of fossil fuels. “Climate change is a real thing, and fossil fuels contribute the most to that issue, and since we are college students, an event like this is the greatest way to make an impact,” she said. Hopkins has held long-standing investments in the fossil fuel industry, which have proven to be a large point of contention between the University administration and student groups.

Since this fall, student groups Refuel Our Future (Refuel) and the JHU Sit-In (Sit-In) have collaborated in fighting for full fossil fuel divestment at Hopkins. Refuel has been holdingFossil Fuel Friday protests on the steps of Gilman Hall every Friday since Nov. 15. The group has stated that the student-led demonstrations will continue until the University has achieved complete divestment. This past spring, the Sit-In held a protest in Garland Hall spanning over one month that ended after the arrests of four students and three community members. The Sit-In is now represented by a coalition of student organizations focused on activism in the Hopkins community. Refuel, which is one such organization, launched in 2011, and has since campaigned for the University to end its investments in companies that produce or sell fossil fuels.

Student climate activist group Refuel Our Future filed a complaint against Hopkins with Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh on Oct. 26, citing University violations of its responsibilities as a charitable nonprofit by continuing to hold investments in fossil fuels. The complaint, which has been signed by 70 students, alumni, community members and faculty, places emphasis on the disproportionate impacts of fossil fuels on underprivileged communities. “The Board of Trustees has a fiduciary duty to invest with consideration for the University’s ‘charitable purposes’ — a duty that distinguishes non-profit institutions from other investors. Instead, the Board of Trustees has invested a portion of the University’s $4.3 billion endowment in the fossil fuel industry — damaging the world’s natural systems, disproportionately harming youth, low-income people, and communities of color, and imperiling the University’s financial and physical condition,” the complaint reads. Refuel Our Future began work on the complaint over a year ago.

Refuel Our Future, a student led fossil fuel divestment campaign at Hopkins, staged a peaceful protest and sit-in on Thursday, Nov. 17 outside Garland Hall. The group demanded that the University respond to their divestment proposal, which demands that the part of its endowment that is invested in fossil fuel companies be eliminated. Addressing the crowd of students gathered in front of Garland, the president of Refuel Our Future, senior Maggie Weese, described reliance on fossil fuels as an unequal distribution of power. She added that the fossil fuel companies’ strength extends beyond their influence over lobbyists and paid researchers. “The real power of the fossil fuel industry is that they’ve kept us complacent. They’ve kept the public complacent, and this is an issue that we cannot be complacent on,” she said. Citing the University’s reputation as a research institution, Weese views the University’s refusal to divest as irresponsible. “We

As one of the co-chairs of the Foreign Affairs Symposium, I am fortunate enough to have the opportunity to spend some extra time with our internationally renowned speakers before and after our events. A few weeks ago, I walked our first keynote speaker, Prince Zeid Ra'ad Zeid Al-Hussein, the Jordanian Ambassador to the United States and a Hopkins alum, to his car, and we discussed a number of different topics. From the United Nations to the war in Iraq (and everywhere in between), the Ambassador had something to say, and my fellow co-chairs and I were happy to listen. But then, all of a sudden, we passed Garland Hall, and the topic changed. "Is that still the admissions building?" Prince Zeid asked us. "No," we responded. "The admissions building is a new building on that new quad behind Garland." Because Garland wasn't that old when the ambassador was a student

 Moments and milestones in the history of women at Hopkins - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

“Imagine yourself a woman, walking into a classroom and being addressed as ‘Gentleman.’ Imagine yourself walking into the gym and being told that you need a male escort in order to use the ping-pong tables… This was the Johns Hopkins University in 1970 and 1971,” Cynthia Young said in her 1974 Hopkins commencement speech. Young was one of the first women to graduate from the undergraduate program at Hopkins. She is one of the many women who made history at the University for being the first. In honor of Women’s History Month, the Editorial Board decided to look at the history of firsts for women at Hopkins. At its founding in 1876, Hopkins was an all-male school. However, this quickly changed with emergence of the women’s suffrage movement in the late 19th century. One of the first places at Hopkins where women were accepted was the School of Nursing, which

Since black undergraduates were first admitted to the University in 1945, they have worked to make Homewood a more inclusive campus. This year the Black Student Union (BSU), founded in 1968, celebrates its 50th anniversary. As Black History Month comes to a close, The News-Letter spoke to black students, alumni and faculty who reflected on how the University has changed over the years. Hopkins Before the Civil Rights Act University founder Johns Hopkins was an abolitionist with Quaker roots. Hopkins also allocated part of his money to the formation of The Johns Hopkins Hospital Colored Orphan Asylum, which operated between 1875 and 1924. Justin Jones, who graduated from Hopkins in 2010, said that the many practices that the University adopted after Hopkins’ death would have been against his own wishes. “There are a lot of questionable things about Johns Hopkins’ history, but the man himself is surprisingly cool,” Jones said.

The Female Leaders of Color (FLOC) and Men of Color Hopkins Alliance (MOCHA) held the Men and Women of Color Symposium last Saturday, March 7, in Charles Commons.

The University expanded gender-affirming care benefits on July 1 to cover additional procedures, including voice therapy and facial reconstructive procedures. These changes put the University in line with the current World Professional Association for Transgender Health standards. Junior Eirnin Mahoney discussed their thoughts on the University’s initiatives in an email to The News-Letter. “This is an important step forward in expanding the University's support for trans people,” they wrote. “However, more needs to be done because there are still some major flaws in the naming systems, such that people's deadnames still show up in University systems all the time.” While students can now change their preferred name and pronouns on SIS, deadnames and initials still appear on MyChart and JHED IDs.

This semester’s hybrid academic format has posed a multitude of technical and logistical challenges for proctoring exams. Contrary to last semester, professors can now opt for in-person exams depending on the format of the class. However, courses are not required to administer their exams in person even if the course offers in-person accommodations. This shift has been viewed as a critical step towards returning to some sense of normalcy, but students and faculty continue to weigh the benefits of each format. In an interview with The News-Letter, Applied Mathematics and Statistics Senior Lecturer Mario Micheli explained his approach to online testing for the past two semesters. Though he was reluctant to proctor exams virtually or force students to lock down their browsers, he was concerned with upholding academic integrity. For his exams, Micheli allowed students to access the internet, their notes and even a calculator, which was a drastic departure

Amid multiple policy changes following the pandemic, the University removed the mid-semester fall break from the fall 2021 calendar. The University has offered a fall break every year since 2010. In interviews with The News-Letter, students shared how the removal of a fall break has impacted them. Junior Angel Garcia feels that a break allows students to adjust to different stages of their college career. “Fall break gives [newer students] a chance to catch their breath and process everything that they’re going through,” he said. “For the older students, it gives them a chance to not burn out since it’s already been a while that we’ve been [in school]. We can use the extra time for ourselves.” Second-year graduate student Yared Haile agreed, emphasizing that a break would have given him time to catch up on ordinary tasks. “I probably would have organized the household, or caught up on groceries

 SGA signs onto letter calling for President Biden to cancel student-loan debt - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Student Debt-Relief Letter Sign-on During the 2020 presidential campaign, President Joe Biden pledged to enact student-loan forgiveness. As part of an effort to push Biden to fulfill this campaign promise, college student governments across the country, including at Hopkins, have been circulating a letter calling on the Biden administration to cancel all federal student-loan debt. Many members of the Student Government Association (SGA) have already signed the letter. “This letter is to call President Biden into accountability for student debt relief. We’re asking his authority if he will cancel all student-loan debt immediately,” Executive President Mehak Ali said. Ali added that SGA hopes the letter will also push Congress to act on the issue. The letter passed unanimously. Mental Health Day Letter In order to unify the various calendars across its campuses, the University has eliminated fall break.

 Physics department to expand faculty, research with $50 million alum donation - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By ISHAN KALBURGE                                                     | January 26, 2022
The Department of Physics & Astronomy received a $50 million donation from investor and Hopkins alum William H. “Bill” Miller III last month. This donation follows Miller’s 2018 gift of $75 million to the University’s philosophy department. According to an email sent to Hopkins affiliates by University President Ronald J. Daniels, this donation prompted two anonymous donations totaling an additional $25 million. According to Daniels, Miller’s donation will sponsor faculty appointments and new graduate research and postdoctoral fellowships in hopes of bolstering the department’s research goals. Formerly named after Hopkins professor Henry A. Rowland, the department has been renamed the William H. Miller III Department of Physics & Astronomy. Timothy Heckman, Dr. A. Hermann Pfund professor and current chair of the department, explained the impact of the donation in expanding the research interests of the department in an interview with The News-Letter. “It’s a transformative gift... and it's mostly going

 Alum gifts $75 million to philosophy department - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Hopkins alum William H. Miller donated $75 million to the University’s philosophy department in January. The donation, the largest ever to a university philosophy program, made national headlines, and the department will now bear the name: William H. Miller Department of Philosophy. Miller, an investor noted for successfully beating the market for 15 years, worked on a Ph.D. in philosophy from Hopkins but left to pursue money management before completing his dissertation. He asserts that philosophy helped him with investment strategies. Richard Bett, professor and chair of the philosophy department, said that he expects to use the gift to grow the department into one that rivals those of the University’s peer institutions. “We’ve always suffered from our small size,” Bett said. “With that number of new positions, we’ll be at the same number as the leading departments.” Plans on how to allocate the donation have not been finalized, and it

The University announced that a new phase of the Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships (BDP) will double the number of professors in the program to 100, launch research clusters and fund new core facilities. Michael Bloomberg’s landmark donation of $350 million created the BDP program in 2013. The program brought together 50 researchers with appointments in more than one department of the University to act as bridges linking different disciplines. According to an email sent to University constituents by University President Ronald J. Daniels, a second gift has allowed the University to recruit 50 additional Bloomberg Distinguished Professors to work in interdisciplinary clusters focused on artificial intelligence (AI), the health effects of climate change, racial equity, neuroscience and pandemic preparedness and response. In interviews with The News-Letter, Bloomberg Distinguished Professors shared their experiences in the program and discussed what makes the program special.

Last spring, Hopkins Hospital paused its long-time practice of suing patients who could not afford their medical treatments. Activists have fought against the University’s aggressive medical debt collection tactics for years. As recently as last month, End Medical Debt Maryland hosted a rally to advocate for the Medical Debt Protection Act, which passed in this year’s Maryland General Assembly. The rally distributed information from ACLU of Maryland’s Know Your Rights program, detailing services and resources for individuals targeted by the Hospital. Because the University is a tax-exempt nonprofit, it is required by law to provide community benefits, such as offering medical services to those who demonstrate need for free or at a reduced cost. However, as highlighted in a 2019 report by National Nurses United (NNU) and the Coalition for a Humane Hopkins, many defendants were never informed about these resources. The report, titled “Taking Neighbors to Court: Johns Hopkins

The U.S. government classifies most colleges and universities as nonprofits because of their “educational purposes,” exempting them from federal income taxes. This means that, despite operating four campuses in Baltimore, Hopkins is not legally required to pay the city any property taxes. In 2016, Baltimore City entered into a 10-year Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) agreement with “anchor institutions,” whereby these institutions were required to pay the city a collective $60 million over the course of 10 years. The University, the Bayview Medical Center and Hopkins Hospital were all represented in this deal, with the University alone paying $1.8 million annually. However, in 2019, many Maryland-based organizations called for PILOT to be renegotiated, arguing that it is only a fraction of what Hopkins would be paying if it were a for-profit institution. In 2019, the University would have paid $26.6 million in property taxes if not for its exempt

Affiliated with United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), the University’s graduate student union Teachers and Researchers United (TRU-UE) officially won recognition through a union representation election facilitated by the National Labor Relations Board in January 2023. Founded in 2014, TRU-UE started as a small group of graduate students in response to the dean’s strategic plan. This year, over 2000 graduate students voted in favor of unionization, resulting in a 97% majority and 64% turnout rate. In an interview with The News-Letter, graduate student Peter Weck, an organizer for TRU-UE since 2017, expressed his excitement for the union to be officially recognized. “For those of us who have been around since the earlier days, the last six months have been pretty surreal — especially to go from a series of years in which the hope that we were going to win the union started to fade to then,

“When we first came here, many of us found that we were not entirely welcome. A great number of men came to Johns Hopkins not wholly receptive to the addition of undergraduate women. There were those who resented the intrusion of women into their male sanctuary; there were those who considered women incapable of surviving academic pressures; and there were those who feared women would be equal competitors. In many instances we felt unusually isolated from the rest of the community.” These are the words read by Cynthia Young at the University’s 1974 commencement. Young, along with the other women who helped write the speech, was part of the first full class of women to graduate from Hopkins. Women were not permitted to attend Hopkins until 1970, when 90 women were admitted to the University. However, the year 1970 marks the tail end of the movement for women’s higher education

 Speak Out Now: In Baltimore and beyond - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Speak Out Now is a socialist group that advocates for active participation in ending capitalism through revolution. According to their website, a socialist system means the “common ownership and sharing of the world’s resources and productive capacity under the democratic control of the world’s peoples,” rather than the exploitation of labor and the ownership of profit by a small number of capitalists. Unlike other student organizations, Speak Out Now is not formally affiliated with Hopkins. Instead, they are a national organization with chapters in the San Francisco Bay Area, New Jersey and Baltimore. Many of the active members of the Baltimore chapter are Hopkins alumni, which is part of the reason why they center a lot of their chapter-specific activities around the Hopkins campus. In an interview with The News-Letter, Meg Chow, an alum of Hopkins, shared her experiences organizing with Speak Out Now for several years. “The end goal,

 The hidden parts of political activism: A look into Hopkins Students for Justice in Palestine - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By LUBNA AZMI                                                     | April 27, 2023
People notice the flashy moments of activism the most: the massive protests, the inspiring speeches and the ratified legislation. Activism is much more than that. Sometimes activism grows through spontaneous spurts of growth, and other times, its roots take time to spread. It's kept alive through the cultivation of continuity through tough moments of growth and active moments of flourishing. The University’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) fits this narrative. SJP is a national student movement advocating for Palestinian liberation and drawing awareness to the plight of the Palestinian people under Israeli occupation. This year marks the University’s SJP’s 10-year anniversary. Since its founding in 2013, the organization has had a resilient history filled with ups and downs. SJP has been a voice advocating not only for the Palestinian cause but also for all those who are oppressed on campus. The organization has had two focuses: education

 The history of student activism at Hopkins and nationwide - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

At the very core of society’s progress, activism has always been integral to sparking change. From macroscopic protests advocating for women’s rights to smaller movements concerning local issues, the freedom to assemble is ingrained in the very founding of the United States. College students especially have always taken advantage of this right. As they transition from childhood to adulthood, undergraduates have a unique understanding of the topics that are affecting both the younger and older generations, and they have the opportunity to make an impact on issues that will still affect them as they grow older. Though not particularly known as an “activist university,” Hopkins has had its fair share of important milestones in activism throughout the years. In many ways, it has mirrored the trends seen in the histories of peer institutions amid ongoing tensions with the administration and movements on nationwide issues. Emeritus Professor Stuart Leslie came to

Divestment has been a demand leveraged by student activists to fight several social issues, including apartheid in South Africa and the unethical practices of tobacco manufacturers. For a little over a decade, student activists have found a new cause around which to mobilize and demand divestment: climate change. The fossil fuel divestment movement, which primarily calls for universities to remove their endowments’ investments in gas, coal and oil companies, began on U.S. college campuses in 2011 with Swarthmore College. Since then, over 100 U.S. colleges and universities have divested, ranging from public institutions like the University of California system to members of the Ivy League like Harvard University. Divestment movements have evolved over time and used a variety of approaches to enact changes, including mobilizing stakeholder groups within universities and launching formal legal complaints. Now, many of these movements also aim to prevent fossil fuel companies from contributing to research

With wins over then number-five Syracuse and top-ranked Virginia in the past week, the Hopkins men's lacrosse team grabbed the number one spot in both the InsideLacrosse/Nike Media Poll and the Coaches Poll for the 104th time in program history. However, the dynamic University of North Carolina attack, led by freshman standout Jimmy Bitter, was relentless against a Hopkins defense that perhaps was poised for a letdown after two emotional victories the previous week. As a result, Hopkins came out flat against the Tar Heels at the Konica Minolta Big-City Classic, letting the Tar Heels take a quick 4-2 lead through most of the first quarter. While junior goaltender Pierce Bassett made several key stops, the defense could not handle the quickness of UNC's Bitter who had two goals in the first 15 minutes. The freshman routinely forced the Hopkins defense to send multiple defenders his way in an attempt

Before junior second baseman Adam Weiner stepped up to the plate this past Friday against Washington College, he had never hit a home run before. The Newark, DE native came up with one out and the score tied at two in the bottom of the ninth inning when he proceeded to send a high fastball way over the left field fence - much to the amazement of the crowd, the Blue Jays and himself.

Standing at six-foot-six, senior right-handed pitcher Alex Eliopoulos has been a towering force all season long for the Hopkins baseball team. Named as a preseason second team All-American by d3baseball. com and a top 10 Division III prospect by PerfectGame. org, the nation's largest baseball recruiting service, Eliopoulos has made good on that billing by starting 2012 with a 4-0 record and a sparkling 1.02 ERA in seven starts. Furthermore, the senior from Arlington, VA leads all Hopkins pitchers with a .217 batting-averageagainst, 47 strikeouts, and 44.1 innings pitched. For his third win of the season, last Tuesday March 28 against Dickinson, Eliopoulos threw a complete game, six-hitter, while striking out a career high 11 in the 3-2 win. Despite throwing 157 pitches in the game, Eliopoulos started against Centennial Conference foe McDaniel College a week later looking to earn his fourth win of the season. When asked about his

This past Thursday, the Hopkins baseball team traveled to Westminster, MD, to take on McDaniel for the second time this season. Beating the Green Terror in their previous meeting, the Jays were looking to complete the season sweep. In a dramatic and thrilling ninthinning finish, the Blue Jays did just that. Senior pitcher Sam Eagleson was on the bump for the Blue Jays when the squad jumped out to an early lead.

May 3, 2012 Five out of five scientists agree: eating is delicious. What Hopkins students don't always agree on however is where to eat. In fact, I've heard students complaining about there not being enough cool places to eat in Baltimore.

Well, whether you've never eaten further off-campus than Subway or you're a regular food explorer, I'm here to take you on a restaurant adventure.

May 3, 2012 There was a bustle rarely found on campus as the crowd walked into Shriver Hall for the Egyptian Sun Hipocalypse belly dance show this Saturday. There were children running around wearing coined hip scarves, parents taking out cameras, and excited spouses getting ready to see their loved ones dance. Throughout the show, a bazaar of sorts was set up, offering jewelry, hip scarves, henna tattoos. A portion of the proceeds from the performance as well as individual audience contributions were donated to the Kennedy Krieger Institute. According to the Institute's web site, their aim is to help "children and adolescents with disorders of the brain, spinal cord and musculoskeletal system achieve their potential" and participate as fully and safely as possible.

May 3, 2012 On Tuesday, actress/singer/fashion designer/tuna expert Jessica Simpson gave birth to a nine-pound, thirteen-ounce baby girl named Maxwell Drew Johnson. "Maxwell" is Simpson's fianc??/baby daddy Eric Johnson's middle name and his grandmother's maiden name, while "Drew" is Simpson's mother's maiden name. Simpson became a household name when she married 98 Degrees singer Nick Lachey.

Since her divorce, J.Simps has been pretty unlucky: when dating Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, fans called his poor performance when she attended games the "Jessica Jinx," some even going so far as to call her "Yoko Romo."

The Hopkins women' s track and field team traveled to Raleigh, North Carolina to partake in the Raleigh Relays this past Friday. Sophomore Holly Clarke and freshman Hannah Eckstein represented the Blue Jays in the event. Clarke and Eckstein placed 10th and 14th in the 10,000-meter event. This was against steep competition, matching up against Division I opponents. For the six mile, 376 yd race, Clarke ran a time of 36:10.39 and Eckstein followed closely behind coming in at 36:33.82. In Division III, these scores took the number two and three spots in the nation.

Now ranked 16th in the National Division III polls, Head coach Jamie Engle's team has won three straight matches. recently rolling over conference competition; Ursinis this past Saturday and Franklin & Marshall this past Tuesday. The Blue Jays came into Saturday's match against the Bears already with two straight shutouts in conference play and followed suit on Saturday. Hopkins jumped to an early lead with the help of freshmen Ed Corty and Noah Joachim in doubles play as they won, 8-0. Next, junior Andy Hersh and freshman Sam Weissler continued to keep the foot on the pedal and won, 8-1. Senior Jacob Barnaby and sophomore German Gonzalez began to see some resistance in the third and final doubles match, but were able to pull out an 8-6

 Many storylines for 2012 Major League Baseball season - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

The 2012 Major League Baseball season began last week in Tokyo, and every team will play its first game by this Friday. With this in mind, it's time to roll out The News-Letter's annual MLB preview. A year ago, I picked the Red Sox over the Brewers in the World Series, harping on their respective off-season additions as the keys to what I thought would be their 2011 title runs. And while I'm not straying from that line of thinking again this year, the 2012 World Series will revolve more around the smaller, less media-frenzied moves than the major free-agent signings of Albert Pujols, Prince Fielder and Yu Darvish that transpired this winter. AL EAST The Winner: New York Yankees. Even in baseball's best division - yes, the AL East still holds an edge over the vast improved AL West and NL East divisions - it's tough to argue against

 Maryland Film Festival to screen diverse films - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

If you're more familiar with words like "chiaroscuro" and "vorkapich montage" than ones like "Canadian egg roll" and "power play," then ditch the lacrosse game this weekend and check out the 14th annual Maryland Film Festival. Well, you don't actually need to skip the lacrosse game because the festival runs all weekend from May 3 to May 6. And even if you don't appreciate esoteric film lingo, there's sure to be something you will appreciate in the 50 feature films and 75 short films that will be screened at the nearby Charles theatre (1711 North Charles Street). The festival will feature narratives, documentaries, animation and experimental and hybrid films. I can't tell you exactly what the last two mean, but based on the celebrity filmmakers who have previously attended, Kathryn Bigelow ("The Hurt Locker"), Jonathan Demme ("The Silence of the Lambs") and David Simon ("The Wire"), everything is sure to

May 3, 2012 Witness Theater, Hopkins's student-run theater group, culminated its year with a Spring Showcase last Friday, Apr. 27 and Saturday, Apr. 28. The showcase featured five student plays and a Throat Culture Sketch Comedy Show. These included junior Jeremy Roth's "ppl are jump roping," senior Kelsey Miller's "Bed Play" and "Hey Arnold," sophomore Alessandra Bautze's "The Girl's Room" and sophomore Matt Pulaski's "High Functioning Autism from Morality, not Genetics." The News-Letter asked Miller and Roth as well as Throat Culture members sophomore Ben Cohen and freshman Rebecca Levine to discuss their experiences in Witness and Throat Culture this year. The News-Letter (N-L): What has been your best memory in Witness/Throat Culture this year? Ben Cohen (BC): This is probably a very director-y answer, but I would say my best memory would be the rehearsals we did for the JCPenny/Campfire sketch that was done for this show. The sketch

 New Vibrations-Rufus Wainwright - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

May 3, 2012 Rufus Wainwright, a Canadian-American singer-songwriter best known for his single "Hallelujah," is back with a new album. Out of the Game is his seventh album, and perhaps his most "pop-like" work, along with hints of old rock artists like Queen and Elton John. Wainwright himself describes his newest album as his most "dancible" yet, probably because of the steady rhythms and pulsing beats in most of the songs. He starts off with "Out of the Game," a catchy song with an upbeat rhythm and tune throughout, in which he complains about how he's "been out [of the game] for a long time now" and how he is "lookin' for something/Can't be found on the main drain, no." After these somewhat bitter lyrics, Wainwright follows it up with "Jericho," another song with heavy pop influences and unhappy lyrics, in which he laments about how he is "a fool

May 3, 2012 Hey, I'm Devin. I'm the new Arts & Entertainment Editor for The News-Letter, and I'm pretty darn excited about that. I'm a pretty excitable person, especially if country or indie music, Ryan Gosling or ice cream is somehow involved. When I'm not writing for The News-Letter, I can be found pretending to be artsy in Chocolatea, drinking inordinate amounts of coffee and painstakingly writing the biography for my future Chocolate Frog trading card. If you haven't thought about what you would want your Chocolate Frog trading card to say, then I'm assuming you must go to Loyola or Towson, in which case you should promptly leave Maxie's or WaWa and bring this fine work of journalism back to your own university's drinking establishment. Disgruntled digression aside, I've been spending the last few weeks thinking about how, two weeks away from completing my sophomore year, I'm almost halfway

May 3, 2012 China has been all over the international news headlines recently, both because of its military talks with the U.S. beginning this week and the recent escape of one of its well-known dissidents from house arrest. The fact that the dissident, Chen Guangcheng, then sought protection in the U.S. embassy, did not ease tensions going into Wednesday's meetings. China's increased military spending (although there is some debate over the size of its defense budget, which some sources claim has seen double-digit growth for the past 20 years) has put the U.S. on edge, while the U.S. presence in Asia has fed into Chinese fears of encirclement. The Chen issue notwithstanding, the Chinese-U.S. Strategic and Economic Dialogue is going forward. Despite the inherent and undeniable importance of human rights issues, this is for the best. China's growth not just in terms of its internal development, but its increasing investment

The Hopkins women's lacrosse team hit the road to Nashville, Tennessee to take on the 15th ranked Commodores of Vanderbilt University in American Lacrosse Conference action. The 19th ranked Lady Blue Jays came into town fresh off a 9-8 nail-biting win against the Tigers of Princeton University. The game was the 14th in a series that dates back ten years, with the 'Dores leading 8-5 including six straight heading into the Sunday afternoon match-up of NCAA women's lacrosse powerhouses. The Commodores again would come out on top and send the Lady Jays home unhappy with a 11-14 loss in a tightly contested game that never saw a cushion larger than three goals for either squad. Vandy came out hot in the opening ten minutes of the first half, jumping out to a two goal lead on a couple of unassisted tallies, only to see the Lady Jays, led by senior

In the past few months, the Hopkins women's tennis team has faced many formidable opponents including top ranked Williams, Tufts and Emory. While the Lady Jays did face several difficult matches and a few defeats, they have become a formidable team themselves, recently moving to the eighth spot in the Division III rankings. The Blue Jays secured their seventh win of the season last Saturday against fellow Centennial Conference school, Ursinus. Mastering both the singles and doubles rounds in their matches against the Bears, Hopkins came out with a sweeping win of 9-0. Starting off the matches were doubles partners junior Andrea Berlinghof and freshman Macie Wilkins, who pulled out an 8-0 win. Senior Courtney Boger, freshman Kaitlin Pfisterer, freshmen Shannon Libaw and Stephanie Rettig then followed with back-to-back sweeps of 8-0. Pfisterer, who cinched the 9-0 win for the Blue Jays, commented that their match-up against the Bears comprised

I admit, I’m a simple being. It takes relatively little to make me happy: warm socks straight from the dryer, cookies fresh from the oven, no homework or impending midterms to stress about and — dragon movies. I will watch any movie with a dragon in it. The Hobbit? Bring it on. How to Train Your Dragon? Of course. Shrek? A classic. So when Damsel, the latest addition to this very specific category of films directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, was released on Netflix on March 8, I of course put aside the assignments and work I had originally planned to tackle this weekend to watch it. I have priorities — fire-breathing reptiles come first. In the movie, Elodie (Millie Bobby Brown) agrees to marry a wealthy prince (Nick Robinson) for his money. The two have a tepid love affair over a few days that culminates in a grand wedding

 Kant's 300th birthday celebrated with an absurdist play presented by Goethe-Institut Washington - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Immanuel Kant, a cardinal and a British millionairess walk onto a steamship headed for America — it sounds like the start of a joke, or, a properly written absurdist play. For the sake of this article, it turns out to be the latter. To celebrate Kant’s 300th birthday, Goethe-Institut Washington, in collaboration with Hopkins, organized a reading of Thomas Bernhard’s Immanuel Kant on Friday, March 8 in the John Astin Theatre. Written by Bernhard, an Austrian mid-19th century playwright, Immanuel Kant imagines the preeminent Enlightenment philosopher (read and performed by Todd Schofield) on a steamboat traveling to America with his wife (Tonya Beckman Ross), his servant Ernst Ludwig (David Bishins) and most importantly, the philosopher’s pet parrot, Friedrich (Michael Glenn). From what I could gather from some extraneous details contained within the script, the date of this voyage is sometime after 1937. If you’re working through the timeline in your

Rise and shine! The second half of the semester is here. I hope you enjoyed your break, although I know most of us still had to do work here and there. That’s Hopkins. C’est la vie. In any case, I hope you caught up on all the shows, films, books and music you put off for midterm exams and essays, because the entertainment industry stops for no one. We’ll do our best to help you stay up to date, find the content you’re actually interested in and move on to the next week. That’s how this works — we tell you what to pay attention to, and you pretend like you have time to watch, read, listen and attend it all. I’d recommend you pay particular attention to the live events this week, as all of them are Hopkins-affiliated, and all of them could be solutions to your mid-semester blues.

There is one specific thing Fast Five and Twilight: Breaking Dawn — Part I have in common... any guesses? Both cult classics and box office hits were set partially in Brazil. Characters danced, infused themselves in the beautiful scenery and spoke terrible Portuguese when they claimed to be fluent. Both films indulge themselves in Brazilian stereotypes and are popular portrayals of Brazilian culture around the world. Yet, Prime Video’s new film Música aims to set itself apart from the rest. In his directorial debut, Rudy Mancuso casts himself as Rudy, a current college student from the Ironbound, N.J., whose mind turns regular sounds into musical tunes that distract him from his everyday life. He carries this burden, while also dreaming of one day becoming a professional puppeteer. We first meet Rudy while he is speaking to his girlfriend Haley (Francesca Reale), a rich white girl, who expresses her disdain for

 COWBOY CARTER: Beyoncé’s country masterpiece - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

From becoming the first Black woman to reach number one on the Hot Country Singles Billboard Chart to having 2024’s most streamed album on Spotify in one day, Beyoncé’s COWBOY CARTER has had nothing short of a fiery debut. Her reintroduction to the country genre in the second of her three-act album project came from a long, thoughtful journey — but the effort was well worth the wait. A native to Houston, Beyoncé’s introduction to country music after achieving stardom was hallmarked by her 2016 performance of “Daddy’s Lessons” with The Chicks at the Country Music Awards (CMAs). This controversial performance received plenty of backlash — despite Beyoncé’s Houston roots and the deep, intertwined history that Black culture has with the country genre, many were upset with her presence at the CMAs, feeling she wasn’t country enough. However, it was this unwelcoming debut that sparked her inspiration to delve deeper

On March 22, a bomb was dropped — or rather, a bar. To be specific: “Motherfuck the big three, n***a it’s just big me.” Kendrick Lamar (K-Dot, Kung Fu Kenny) came out swinging against his primary competition in retaliation to a playful diss released in October of last year. Drake’s No. 1 hit off his latest studio album For All the Dogs, “First Person Shooter (feat. J. Cole),” took shots that echoed across the rap game, mainly from J. Cole: “Love when they argue the hardest MC / Is it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me? / We the big three like we started a league, but right now, I feel like Muhammad Ali.” The “big three” of hip hop — Drake, J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar — are at war. J. Cole and Drake’s alliance on “First Person Shooter” was already a historical moment; it’s rare that these three

After an embarrassing venture in written poetry, with such insightful lines as, “There are two types of women in this world / women who like giving head and women who I don’t like,” Adonis’ favorite rapper and Grammy Award-winning artist Aubrey Graham (aka Drake) is back in full form. This past Friday, Oct. 6, he released his anticipated album, For All the Dogs, which had the highest opening day streaming numbers since Her Loss, clocking in 109 million listens. For the longest time, the only thing we knew about this album was its cover art, designed by Drake’s son Adonis, and the promise (from the man himself) that this album would be a return of the “Old Drake.” To put things lightly, he didn’t deliver on this statement; this album is far from an If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, or even a Take Care.

I love an angsty musical. There is nothing more entertaining to me than actors breaking into fully choreographed show tunes in the middle of dramatic, emotional scenes. The more pirouettes and tap dance numbers, the better. Nothing says emotional carnage like jazz hands. I blame watching High School Musical 2 at a young and impressionable age. Because of this, the Barnstormers’ production of Joe Iconis and Joe Tracz’s Be More Chill was right up my alley. It instantly transported me back to my high school years and the accompanying agony of awkward social interactions, but with the added bonus of catchy song and dance numbers, which I deeply appreciated. In the musical, Jeremy (Jackson Robien) is an unpopular high school student with only one real friend, Michael (Kenneth Elsman). After his longtime unrequited crush Christine (Rory Li) signs up for the school musical, Jeremy also signs up to get close

In a continued effort to bring relevant plays to Homewood Campus, JHU Theatre recently presented Galileo, a play by Bertolt Brecht, with five performances from Wednesday, April 3 through Sunday, April 7. The production comes in a long line of scientifically and academically centered plays selected by the department, including Aristophanes’ The Clouds and D.W. Gregory’s sobering Radium Girls, which portrayed the startling effects of radium on women working in a dial-painting factory. The play tells the story of Galileo Galilei’s (Katherine Budinger) astronomical discoveries, specifically his founding of the Copernican system, which denied that Earth was the center of the universe and proved the solar system was, indeed, heliocentric. In order to attain funding to support his scientific research, after gaining a tip from Ludovico Marsili (Hanna Al-Kowsi) about the telescope being used in sailing, Galileo makes his own telescope and markets it as a new invention.

 Like something so natural: The musical poetry of Adrianne Lenker’s Bright Future - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Those who know Adrianne Lenker, indie folk singer and lead vocalist of Big Thief, cannot help but feel like she has done it again — that is, retreat to a little cabin in the woods and come back to us with an album full of free treasure. For those who are unfamiliar, here is what you must know: She is tender, she strikes hard. With deft wit and infinite care she will take you under her wing and sing you songs about the soft corners of the world. She will spook you and reassure you in turns. In Bright Future, Lenker slips between her old haunts (love ballads, acoustic guitar, simple lyricism) and newer preoccupations, adding technological audio flourishes and references to ecological disaster. The title looks forward in time, yet the tracks meander through different perspectives. Some are nostalgic, caught up in the past, while others allude to the

From watching this neo-noir film, it’s obvious that Kristen Stewart has diverged from her role in Twilight. In Love Lies Bleeding, she embodies Lou, an exhausted but competent part-time gym manager, part-time crime scene disrupter. Lou is a reclusive lesbian and estranged daughter of a crime lord in her New Mexico hometown. In the midst of the grunt work of her daily life, she falls in love with Jackie, a bodybuilder new to ‌town, who frequents the gym Lou manages. Before long, the two find themselves entangled in an all-consuming relationship that begins to fracture as the two enter a world of unbelievable violence. Rose Glass, known for her critically acclaimed debut psychological horror film Saint Maud, is a director who knows how to capture the bloody, pulpy and wild scenes that fill the narrative of Love Lies Bleeding.

Last month, the film Problemista was released in theaters. It stars and is directed by Julio Torres. The story centers around a young man named Alejandro who, after losing his job in a cryogenics company, has one month to find another job and sponsor before his work visa in the United States expires and he is deported. While working in his previous job, he meets Elizabeth (Tilda Swinton), an eccentric art critic whose husband is currently cryogenically frozen. When she finds out about Alejandro’s situation, she offers to hire and sponsor him in return for his help with creating an art show, whose profits she would use to pay for her husband’s treatment. We follow Alejandro through an odyssey of ups and downs, Craigslist jobs and negative bank account balances, as he desperately tries to follow his dreams of becoming a toy designer while also making sure he is not

 Studio North: A creative haven for student filmmakers at Hopkins - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Hopkins is often, unfairly, considered a STEM-focused school. And yet, on an almost weekly basis, I have witnessed and been deeply impressed by students on this campus engaging in art that is endlessly creative, thoughtful and even experimental. Studio North is an organization on campus that I think very few have heard of. But for those in the know, it is a deeply passionate and close-knit organization of students who devote themselves to film and the craft of filmmaking. Studio North is the only student-run film production company on campus, and this year they celebrate their 10th anniversary. They teach students how to make films and, every year, award two students grants to make their own short films. Studio North is different from other film-related clubs and classes on campus because, rather than focusing on appreciating films, they give students the opportunity to actually make them.

Do you hear that wooshing noise? That’s the sound of this semester positively flying by! As we get into the final weeks of the semester, there’s guaranteed to be more and more live events happening on campus as students come show off what they’ve been working on these past months. The live events this week are all super cool, so definitely go check them out! You’ve probably seen the posters all over campus by now, but this week, the Program in Theatre Arts and Studies is performing their production of Galileo by Bertolt Brecht. Another fun event happening right on campus is the Edible Books Festival, where you can go to judge students’ most creative literary-culinary concoctions (and most importantly, stuff your faces with free cake). Also, be sure to check out the Ébène Quartet performance at Shriver on Sunday! I had the opportunity to see them perform a few

This week, there’s a wide range of arts and entertainment to enjoy — from the highly anticipated new Taylor Swift album to a movie about a family of Sasquatches living in the woods. For movies, be sure to check out Sasquatch Sunset, which is guaranteed to be a viewing experience like no other. However, if you want something a bit more conventional, check out horror movie Abigail or World War II action movie The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare. In books, it is a glowing week for memoirs. If you want to cry, read Genevieve Kingston’s memoir about how the letters and gifts left to her by her late mother changed her life. Or, read novelist Salman Rushdie’s account of the near-fatal assassination attempt that was all over the news in 2022. The Swifties are

 Hopkins jumps to seventh in U.S. News & World Report's national university rankings - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By HELEN LACEY                                                     | September 13, 2022
The University ranked seventh in the nation according to the 2022–2023 U.S. News & World Report national university rankings published Sept. 11. This is a jump from the university’s previous position at ninth, which it maintained for two consecutive years. Hopkins is now tied with the University of Pennsylvania. U.S. News & World Report relies on a variety of differently weighted metrics, ranging from undergraduate academic reputation to financial resources per student to determine college rankings. The system has faced criticism for the placing greater weight on metrics such as institutional wealth, rather than on social mobility. Hopkins also ranks as the ninth best value school in the nation, ties with University of Maryland, Baltimore County as the tenth most innovative school in the nation and ties with multiple universities as 326th in top performers on social mobility. In an interview with The News-Letter, sophomore Claire Kim discussed the arbitrary

Hopkins ranked ninth in the nation according to the 2022 U.S. News & World Report national university rankings published earlier this week, maintaining its spot from last year. Hopkins is tied with California Institute of Technology, Duke University and Northwestern University. According to its website, U.S. News & World Report uses independently weighted metrics ranging from graduation and retention rates to student selectivity and undergraduate reputation. While metrics like social mobility and financial resources are factored into the calculation, they are not weighted as much as other metrics. In interviews with The News-Letter, students reacted to the updated rankings. Freshman Marco Azar praised the rankings, stating that the University put special emphasis on the undergraduate academic experience. He believed that the student-to-faculty ratio and the expertise of professors were significant factors in upholding the University’s ranking. The rankings also gave him a sense of pride, one that he expects will

U.S. News & World Report ranked Hopkins at ninth best university in the country in its 2021 Best National University Rankings, moving up from the 10th place spot last year. Hopkins is tied with the California Institute of Technology and Northwestern University — ranked 11th and ninth in 2020, respectively — and has placed above Duke University, with which it was tied last year. Other major international college rankings metrics place the University in the mid-20s, with Niche and QS World University Rankings ranking Hopkins 21st and 25th, respectively. The University ranked 12th in the world on the recently released Times Higher Education World University Rankings. U.S. News bases its overall rankings on various factors, including faculty resources, selectivity, alumni-giving rate, classroom size and graduate indebtedness. Each ranking system weighs these factors differently. Freshman Kobi Khong stated that he is pleased with the ranking even though he recognizes the process

Hopkins has once again been ranked 10th in the nation among U.S. News and World Report’s 2020 Best National Universities. Hopkins is tied with Duke University on the rankings, placing immediately above CalTech and Dartmouth University and is ranked immediately below Northwestern University. Hopkins moved up from its previous ranking as the 11th best national university into the top 10 last year. A number of other major college ranking systems place Hopkins in the mid-20s, with Niche and Forbes ranking Hopkins 22nd and 27th, respectively. The Wall Street Journal, in partnership with Times Higher Education, recently ranked Hopkins as 12th in the world, after ranking the University as 19th last year. The general university rankings differ primarily based on which formulas are used to calculate ranking. U.S. News rankings are calculated by comparing universities’ outcomes for students, faculty resources, expert opinion, financial resources, student excellence and alumni giving. Niche, on

Over 1,300 new students arrived on campus last week to participate in the University’s annual Orientation Week for first years. “O-Week” aims to help incoming first years adjust to life at Hopkins. During past Orientation Weeks, first-year students were organized at random into peer-mentor led First-Year Mentor (FYM) groups of 20-25 students each. This year, however, FYM groups were assigned by residence hall floors or houses. Freshman Jeremy Hoffner believes that being in an FYM group with people who lived in close proximity helped him become closer to his neighbors. “I’m glad that they did it by areas in the dorms, so we can just come and knock on each other’s doors if we want to,” he said. “It’s much more like a community now.” In an email to The News-Letter, First-Year Experience Coordinator Brittany Claridge wrote that unlike previous years, this year’s O-week was organized thematically. According to Claridge,

Democrat Wes Moore, a Hopkins alum and former non-profit executive, was elected to be the 63rd governor of Maryland. Succeeding Governor Larry Hogan, Moore will be the first Black governor of Maryland and the third in the history of the United States. Garnering upwards of 900,000 votes, Moore held a comfortable lead over his main opponent, Republican nominee Dan Cox. Moore ended the night with 59.8% of the reported vote, compared to Cox’s 37%. Raymond Perez, co-president of Hopkins College Democrats, voiced the importance of Moore’s election in the present in an email to The News-Letter. “The Maryland electorate sees through far-right politics, but also because it showcases that candidate quality matters,'' he wrote. “The energy of the Moore campaign was simply insurmountable for the incumbent Republican party, and their defeat is a rejection of the Maryland Republican smoke-and-mirrors that so often angles the party as ‘moderate.’” As polls across

Hopkins alumnus James Anderson and his spouse, Morag Anderson, donated $100 million to the University’s School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) Europe. In recognition of the donation, which is the largest private contribution to a university in Italy, the Bologna Center campus will now bear the name “The Johns Hopkins SAIS Europe Bologna Center James and Morag Anderson Campus.” James Anderson, based in the U.K., runs investment organizations in both Stockholm, Sweden and Edinburgh, U.K. He studied at the SAIS Bologna Center for his Master's in International Affairs and holds the position of Hopkins trustee and Advisory Council chairman. In an email to the student body, President Ronald J. Daniels announced that the donation will be used to hire more full-time resident faculty, offer financial assistance to both undergraduate and graduate students, expand the existing Bologna campus and create an integration fund to support faculty and staff engaging in cross-disciplinary

The University admitted 278 students to the Class of 2027 through the Early Decision II (ED II) round on Feb. 17. The newly accepted cohort joins the 533 students that were accepted in December through the Early Decision I (ED I) cycle. This is the third year that Hopkins has offered an ED II cycle in addition to ED I and Regular Decision. In an email to the News-Letter, admitted student Angela Guo described the moment of finding out she had been accepted from the ED II round. “I was super nervous since the time the decision was released, [which] was right after my last class ended,” she wrote. “I opened it right at three, and I remember [my teacher and I] both started shouting and freaking out. It was super emotional, and I’d relive that moment again and again.” Armaan Bahl, who was admitted in the ED I cycle,

“It’s definitely a nice Valentine’s gift because I’m used to rejection on Valentine's Day,” said Jackson Morris, who was recently admitted to the Class of 2025. Early Decision II (ED II) results were released on Friday, Feb. 12. Hopkins accepted 304 of 2,874 applicants, according to Danielle Bernard, director of marketing and communications in the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. This was the first year an ED II round was offered in addition to the Early Decision I (ED I) and Regular Decision (RD) cycles. ED applicants receive their admission offer earlier than RD applicants on the condition that they will commit to attending if they are admitted. ED I applicants have an earlier deadline in mid-November, while ED II and RD applications are due in early January. Newly admitted students join 520 others who were admitted through ED I in December from a historically high applicant pool that saw an

Hopkins Medicine is launching a new center to study psychedelics, the first institution of its kind in the U.S. and one of only a few around the world investigating these types of compounds. The new Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, announced on Sept. 4, will support research focusing on the effects of psychedelic drugs on the brain and mental disorders. Psychedelic drugs primarily trigger an altered state of consciousness, and include compounds such as LSD, psilocybin and mescaline. Some of these are well known as recreational drugs; psilocybin, for instance, is found in what are commonly known as “magic mushrooms.” Sophomore Dylan Peters, who is majoring in Neuroscience and will be working in the new center as a research intern, explained why psychedelics are such a promising option for the treatment of mental health disorders. “One of the novel components of psilocybin is that it’s basically a mental reset,”

The Committee on Student Elections (CSE) announced the results of the 2023–2024 Student Government Association (SGA) Executive Board and class council elections on the evening of March 15, three hours after voting closed.

Correction: The previous headline and article incorrectly stated that 20.3% of eligible undergraduates voted in the elections. The Committee on Student Elections (CSE) announced the results of the 2022-2023 Student Government Association (SGA) Executive Board and class council elections on earlier this month. Three out of the four executive board positions were uncontested. The 2022-2023 SGA Executive Board will consist of Breanna Soldatelli as executive president, Kobi Khong as executive vice president, Elaina Regier as executive secretary and Kya Nicholson as executive treasurer. Khong, Regier and Nicholson ran uncontested and on a ticket together. CSE reported 1,025 votes out of 5,040, which comes out to 20.3%. This is an increase from last year, when 12% of the eligible student body voted in the election. In total, 426 votes were cast for executive board elections, 151 votes for senior class elections, 251 votes for junior class elections, and 197 votes for

The Committee on Student Elections (CSE) announced the results of the 2021-22 Student Government Association (SGA) executive board and class council elections on March 29. Three out of four members of the SMART ticket and one independent candidate won seats in the executive board elections, in which only one position was contested. The 2021-22 SGA Executive Board will include junior Mehak Ali as executive president, sophomore Breanna Soldatelli as executive vice president, freshman Elaina Regier as executive secretary and sophomore Karen He as executive treasurer. He ran as an independent candidate against freshman Harvey McGuinness, who ran on the SMART ticket with Ali, Soldatelli and Regier. Ali won the position of executive president with 594 votes. Soldatelli received 568 votes for executive vice president, and Regier received 601 votes for executive secretary. All three candidates ran unopposed. He won as executive treasurer with 402 votes, beating McGuinness, who received 229

The candidates for the 2021-22 Student Government Association (SGA) Executive Board include a single ticket, SMART, and one independent candidate, Karen He. For the second year, the executive board election will coincide with SGA class council elections. Voting will begin after the candidate debate on Thursday and end on Sunday. Unlike last year, when three candidates ran for executive president, this year’s election is highly noncompetitive with three out of the four positions being uncontested. Junior Mehak Ali is running for executive president on the SMART ticket, alongside sophomore Breanna Soldatelli for executive vice president, freshman Elaina Regier for executive secretary and freshman Harvey McGuinness for executive treasurer. Ali and Soldatelli are members of the 2020-21 Executive Board, serving as executive vice president and executive secretary, respectively. Regier and McGuinness are both freshman class senators.

Two tickets, Focus Forward and Taking Flight, and an independent candidate, Sam Mollin, are running in the Student Government Association’s (SGA) executive board elections. The voting period will begin on Friday and end on March 11. Unlike past years, the student body will now vote for candidates to SGA’s class councils and executive board at the same time. According to Committee on Student Elections (CSE) Chair Bahira Ahmed, this will encourage voter turnout and decrease student apathy toward SGA elections, while also extending the transition period between the incoming and outgoing executive boards. The Focus Forward ticket includes sophomore Pritika Parmar running for executive president, sophomore Mehak Ali for executive vice president, junior Addy Perlman for executive treasurer and freshman Breanna Soldatelli for executive secretary. Parmar is currently SGA’s executive secretary; Ali is the incumbent executive vice president; Perlman is a junior class senator; and Soldatelli is freshman class president.

The Student Government Association (SGA) held their final meeting of the 2017-2018 academic year on Tuesday in Charles Commons. At the meeting, SGA passed their 40th piece of legislation, which is double the combined number of bills passed in the past two years. Members of the SGA also gave their final reports. SGA voted to pass the Powers and Authorities Resolution. Executive Vice President AJ Tsang, who authored the legislation, explained that the resolution would allow SGA to expand its influence in University decisions. In the legislation, Tsang calls for shared governance between SGA and administrators and advocates for the incorporation of young trustees and alumni who have graduated no more than three years ago into the Board of Trustees. Sophomore Class Senator Dean Chien believes that SGA relies too heavily on maintaining a friendly relationship with the departments that financially support them. Chien voiced his support for the stipulation

The 2018-19 Student Government Association (SGA) referendum, with 2,738 total voters on eight key issues, reached more students than any SGA ballot since 2012, according to AJ Tsang, who served as the group’s executive president last spring. The referendum is intended to expand SGA’s influence over the University’s decisions. According to Tsang’s report, 42.5 percent of the student body participated in the referendum over the course of the 2018-19 academic year. The referendum asked students to vote “yes” or “no” on eight questions regarding issues pertinent to the undergraduate community. For example, 2042 students (85.9 percent of participants) called for an undergraduate observer member on the Board of Trustees. The referendum is meant to offer concrete data on student opinion, Tsang said, in order to validate SGA’s policy objectives to administrators. However, some students questioned whether the referendum would enhance SGA’s ability to effect change on campus. Senior Aran Chang,

The Student Government Association (SGA) elected former Sophomore Class Senator Mehak Ali as the new Executive Vice President during their weekly meeting on Tuesday. SGA members nominated Ali to succeed Dean Chien, who became executive president following Aspen Williams’ resignation. Williams confirmed in an email to The News-Letter that she had chosen to resign, effective immediately. “I am now at a point where it is time for me to no longer be a member of SGA. Instead I’m focusing on activism and advocacy beyond Hopkins and figuring out how these efforts will play a role in my future career,” she wrote. Ali ran against Senior Class Senators Chanel Lee and Kahmil Shajihan. At the meeting, Ali expressed her hopes to continue being a voice for students. “I joined SGA as a freshman because I wanted to start... fostering a sense of community at Hopkins,” she said. “I believe that as

At the Student Government Association (SGA)’s weekly meeting on Tuesday, Senior Class Senator Chase McAdams introduced the Senators and Student Organizations Pairing Act. In accordance with the bill, SGA’s Committee on Student Organizations (CSO) will pair each of eight student groups with a senator. As CSO chair, McAdams explained that this will allow student groups to receive greater support and resources from SGA, like personnel contacts and knowledge of University policy. “Of all the stuff we do, the organizations are the most important piece. They represent a majority of the student body; 80 percent of students participate in them,” he said. “If there’s anyone to take on this responsibility, it’s us.” The Committee on Student Elections (CSE) presented changes to its constitution intended to allow SGA to interface more directly with students.

Under this change, students requesting learning accommodations must email their professors directly; before, professors were notified of their students’ accommodations automatically. In an email to The News-Letter, junior Caroline Cerilli, who is hard of hearing, noted that labeling oneself as “disabled” can be difficult and having students reach out to professors individually places too much of a burden on the student. Cerilli added that this practice further exacerbates the differences between students who require accommodations and those who do not. “Accommodations are not ‘extra’ or ‘special’ — they are what allow students to have an equitable experience at Hopkins,” she wrote. “The power imbalance between the student and the professor is too great. We should not feel embarrassed or like a burden by asking for basic needs.” In

The Committee on Student Elections announced the results of the Student Government Association (SGA) Freshman Class Council elections on Saturday, Sept. 26. Due to coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions, candidates could only campaign virtually. For the 2020-21 academic year, the freshman class president is Kobi Khong, and the freshman class senators are Raj Bhatt, Jenny Chen, Harvey McGuinness, Ireland Parrish, Elaina Regier and Benjamin Scherzer. The freshman class elections drew a significant decrease in voter turnout, with 44% of the Class of 2024 voting compared to 56% of the Class of 2023. Four candidates ran for the presidency, while six senators were chosen from a field of 27. Freshman Class President Kobi Khong, who won with 246 votes by a 40-point lead, believes that his involvement in online platforms, such as Discord and GroupMe, helped him with the election. “We were a bunch of Hopkins-admitted kids stranded across everywhere.

The Student Government Association (SGA) discussed various pro-voting initiatives for students at its weekly meeting on Tuesday, Sept. 15. One such initiative was the Time Off to Vote (TOTV) open letter campaign, created by the student-led, nonpartisan organization Every Vote Counts. The campaign was presented to SGA by Executive Director Campbell Streator, who explained that the goal was to empower student voters once they enter the workforce and to eliminate obstacles standing in the way of voter participation. “I recognized a specific power that students as future employees can have in reaching out to their future employers to advocate for issues like time off to vote,” Streator said. “We’re advocating for students on campus being able to vote, and it makes sense to try and do something for their first steps out of college.” The letter, drafted by students in collaboration with their student groups and associations, is aimed at

 Voting in a pandemic: Hopkins students navigate challenges with absentee voting - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has changed how many Americans will cast their ballot in the upcoming election. To limit COVID-19’s spread, many states have made mail-in voting more accessible as a safer alternative to voting in-person. This election is expected to be the largest mail-by-vote election in the history of the United States. Maryland has sent an application to request an absentee ballot to every registered voter in the state. Other states, like California and New Jersey, have automatically sent absentee ballots. Hopkins Votes has been working to increase voting rates at Hopkins, notably through its Commit to 100 percent campaign that aims to get student organizations to register all of their members to vote. Today is National Voter Registration Day, which is celebrated on the fourth Tuesday of every September. Junior Reshmi Patel, the events and resources coordinator of Hopkins Votes, stated that she is working to support students

The Student Government Association discussed mid-semester course evaluations and guidelines for the Student Activities Commission at its weekly meeting on Tuesday, March 9. Junior Class Senator Veda Chanda and Freshman Class Senator Raj Bhatt introduced a resolution implementing mid-semester course evaluations. In addition to the end-of-semester course evaluations, the resolution will implement course evaluations after a first exam or paper has been submitted. Chanda argued that their resolution would improve both course quality and student and faculty experiences. “Once course evaluations are done once the semester is done and students have moved onto a new course, it’s less likely that professors will be able to implement effective change because there’s no dialogue,” he said. Bhatt echoed Chanda, explaining that the change would allow students to voice their concerns. “We can’t just say to ourselves, ‘If there’s an issue, students will bring them up individually to professors.’ You might not want

I originally ran for the Student Government Association (SGA) on a whim. It wasn’t even something on my mind in February 2020, but after talking to a graduating senator, it was all I could think about — what platform I would run on, who I would run on a ticket with, what changes I was truly excited about making to our institution and our SGA and so on. Especially in the void of purpose in my life that the pandemic created in March 2020, the at-once terrifying and exciting prospect of running for SGA was all-consuming. It seemed like an amazing way to make a lasting impact on Hopkins as a senior and experienced student leader. I was saddened by the state of SGA that Chanel Lee, a former SGA senator, described in their op-ed from last spring (give it a read for context), and I wanted to work to

I don’t know how best to start this. With the Student Government Association (SGA) elections suddenly moved up with such short notice to the student body and beginning on Friday, I find that this may be the most, if not only, appropriate time to air these opinions. Having been a senator for almost a year and a half, I wanted to share some personal thoughts that have stuck with me since last semester about SGA. The views reflected in this piece are mine alone. Many students may not realize that SGA is a heavily time-consuming and emotionally-taxing commitment. In a typical week, I devote at least five hours to Senate, Senior Class Council and committee meetings. But these five hours do not include the time I spend outside of these meetings writing bills and legislation, planning and hosting Class Council and committee events, corresponding with fellow SGA members, and meeting

Elections for the Executive Board of the 2022-23 Student Government Association (SGA) include a single ticket and three independent candidates. For the third year, the Executive Board election will coincide with SGA class council elections. Voting begins on Monday, March 14 and runs through Thursday, March 17. Like last year, three out of four of the positions are uncontested; however, three different candidates are running for the position of executive president, including junior and current Executive Vice President Breanna Soldatelli, junior and current Executive Treasurer Karen He and junior Raymond Perez. On a ticket, sophomore Kobi Khong, sophomore Elaina Regier and freshman Kya Nicholson are running for the uncontested positions of executive vice president, executive secretary and executive treasurer, respectively. Khong currently serves as the sophomore class president, Regier as the executive secretary and Nicholson as a freshman class senator. Race for the Executive Presidency In an interview with The

Editor’s Note: This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available. The 19th annual Lighting of the Quads, organized by the Parents Fund and the Office of Leadership Engagement and Experiential Development, took place Tuesday evening on Dec. 5. This year, students gathered in the back of the Milton S. Eisenhower Library during the lighting of the fireworks in a silent demonstration supporting Palestinians in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. The Hopkins Justice Collective organized the demonstration. With 5,555 students registered on Campus Groups, Lighting of the Quads is one of the biggest student events during the semester and an iconic tradition on Homewood Campus. Hosting the demonstration during Lighting of the Quads was a purposeful choice, according to leaders of Hopkins Justice Collective in an interview with The News-Letter. Students remained silent during this protest, in contrast with vocal demonstrations during previous protests. The demonstration

The Atlantic announced on Sunday, Feb. 4 that it had suspended its relationship with Hopkins political scientist Yascha Mounk after a journalist accused him of rape on social media platform X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Mounk is a Stavros Niarchos Foundation Agora Institute Senior Fellow and an associate professor of the Practice of International Affairs at the School of Advanced International Studies. He has written five books and is known for his research into the rise of populism and the crisis of liberal democracies. Anna Bross, a spokeswoman for The Atlantic, posted a statement declaring the end of the magazine’s relationship with Mounk. ”We have not published any new work by the freelance contributor since being made aware of the allegation and we suspended our relationship with the freelance contributor last month when we first learned of the accusation,” the statement read.

Editor’s Note: This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available. The Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore collapsed early Tuesday, March 26 after a large container ship crashed into a support column. A construction crew of eight people and at least seven cars were on the bridge and fell into the Patapsco River. The crash occurred at around 1:30 a.m., and the bridge collapsed in a matter of seconds. Two construction workers, who were repairing potholes on the bridge at the time of impact, have been rescued, while the remaining six other workers are presumed dead. Measurements on Tuesday indicate that the water temperature was cold enough to cause hypothermia. Extensive search and rescue efforts were coordinated by personnel from local fire and police departments, the Coast Guard and the Baltimore Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as multiple air and marine units.

On Monday, April 8, hundreds of Hopkins students and community members gathered on the Beach to watch the 2024 total solar eclipse. Beginning at 2:05 p.m. and lasting until 4:33 p.m., the eclipse allowed viewers to see a rare sight: the moon passing between the sun and the Earth. The three-body system of the Earth, moon and sun is arranged in exactly the right configuration of distances and sizes that enables the moon to match the diameter of the sun exactly. Even so, it takes specific conditions to produce a total eclipse. The moon must be perfectly passing through the orbital plane of the Earth around the sun — known as the ecliptic — and be at its minimum distance from Earth. The interval between these conditions is known as a saros, a period of 18.03 years after which the same eclipse will reappear, albeit at a different point on

The University’s graduate student union Teachers and Researchers United (TRU-UE) hosted a picket protest in front of Homewood Campus on Tuesday, Feb. 20. Members protested for a better contract with the University, with provisions including better compensation and the establishment of a closed union shop. TRU-UE is affiliated with United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), a nationwide trade union with over 35,000 members. Union members picketed with signs from both UE and TRU during their protest. In their press release, TRU-UE highlighted the importance of graduate student labor and threatened to prepare for further escalations if the bargaining process did not progress. Several union members were quoted in their demands for future negotiations, including Emily Hoppe, a Ph.D. worker in the School of Nursing. “We envision a different, better, inclusive, thriving vision of graduate school where we don’t have to suffer.

Editor’s Note: This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available. The U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) initiated an investigation into the University on Tuesday, Feb. 13 over its alleged failure to respond to campus anti-semitism, which is in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VI prohibits discrimination based on one’s race, color or national origin, including harassment based on a person’s shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics. As a higher institution receiving federal financial assistance from the Department, the University’s potential violation of Title VI is within the jurisdiction of OCR. In an email to The News-Letter, a University spokesperson emphasized the University’s commitment to upholding its core values through enforcing University policy and the student code of conduct. “Johns Hopkins University abhors anti-Semitism and discrimination of any kind.

One ticket and four independent candidates have joined the race for the 2024–2025 Student Government Association (SGA) Executive Board elections. The SGA Executive Board debate will be held on Wednesday, March 6, and voting will be open from March 11–12. Two candidates are running for student body president: current Sophomore Class President Stone Meng and Black Caucus Senator Tyler Turner. Two candidates are running for student body vice president: Secretary Amy Li and President of the Senate Nasreen Naqvi. Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Senator Tim Huang, Junior Class Senator Brandon Benjamin and Co-Assistant Secretary Buse Koldas are the only candidates running for chair of programming, treasurer and secretary, respectively.

The new Chloe Center for the Critical Study of Racism, Immigration, and Colonialism is a research center that officially launched this semester. The center emerged from the Program in Racism, Immigration, and Citizenship (RIC) founded in 2006 and is currently directed by Professor Stuart Schrader. With this expansion, the Chloe Center plans to continue programs from the RIC, such as open roundtables and the Graduate Student Symposiums, in addition to expanding and bringing more people into its orbit. While RIC was primarily oriented towards graduate students, the Chloe Center aims to actively integrate undergraduate students. As such, the center is offering summer research grants that allow undergraduates to collaborate with a faculty member, which were previously only provided to graduate students. The undergraduate fellow position was added to its team this year as well. Another ongoing project geared towards undergraduates is the Critical Diaspora Studies (CDS) Major initiative, which has

The Program in Racism, Immigration and Citizenship (RIC) hosted the first of a two-part conversation on Friday, Oct. 13 to discuss the importance of community-engaged research, the critical diaspora studies major and the new Penn 555 building in Washington D.C. The event included brief presentations by both faculty members and undergraduate students, moderated by senior Kobi Khong. The conversation began with opening statements from Dr. Stuart Schrader, associate director of the RIC. Schrader explained that though most majors are open to a community-engaged research component, the RIC’s new undergraduate major, Critical Diaspora Studies (CDS), makes it a central feature. “The reason we are here today is for you to hear from some experts, both faculty and students, on community-engaged research and learning, why it's important, what the value of it is for people’s intellectual, spiritual and political growth and how it raises challenges as well,” he said.

Two Class of 2026 senators in the Student Government Association (SGA), Srigouri Oruganty and Shruti Tyagi, are spearheading an initiative to establish a South Asian Studies minor. The minor is expected to consist of 14-20 credits, with core courses in history, geopolitics, sociology and theology. While the minor is currently in the early planning stage, the senators hope this program will provide interdisciplinary and individualized electives. In an interview with The News-Letter, Oruganty, who is also part of the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences (KSAS) Curriculum Committee, explained that she and Tyagi first came up with the idea last semester after observing a gap in the curriculum. Currently, ethnic studies offered by the University include Africana Studies, East Asian Studies, Islamic Studies, Jewish Studies, Latin American, Caribbean and Latinx Studies, and Near Eastern Studies. “We do have minors for a lot of different ethnic groups and backgrounds, but it

The candidates for the 2024–2025 SGA Executive Board took part in a debate on Wednesday, March 6, during which they answered questions about their platforms, the expanding structure of SGA and solutions to various issues on campus. The debate featured seven candidates who are competing for five positions. Sophomores Stone Meng and Tyler Turner are running for president. Junior Nasreen Naqvi and sophomore Amy Li are running for vice president. The remaining three positions are uncontested, with sophomore Tim Huang, freshman Buse Koldas and junior Brandon Benjamin running for chair of programming, secretary and treasurer, respectively. During the debate, candidates were prompted to introduce their past initiatives as well as ones they plan to implement in the future, if elected.

A demonstration in solidarity with Palestine took place on Monday, March 11. Around 20 students convened in front of the Beach on North Charles Street to protest the ongoing violence in Gaza. The protest was organized by Hopkins Students for Palestine and involved students from various groups on campus, including Speak Out Now and the Hopkins Justice Collective. According to the flyer, the protesters’ official demand is for the University to divest from companies that supply the Israeli armed forces, such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Lucas Seitz Miller, a senior and organizer of the protest, described why it was so important to organize this event at this time in an interview with The News-Letter. “We felt like activity surrounding what Israel is doing in Gaza had died down so much, in a way that’s very frustrating,” he said. “People get very invigorated about an issue and then have

On March 8, sophomore Biophysics student Ethan Posner passed away from a brief illness. In his freshman year, Posner was selected as a recipient of the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, a three-year undergraduate research funding program that provides up to $10,000. Some students, faculty and community members are pushing to rename the fellowship to the Ethan Posner Fellowship in honor of him. Sophomore Jason Shumsky and junior Arham Alam, both friends of Posner and the latter a Woodrow Wilson Fellow, are leading the initiative. They are collecting the names and testimonies of people in support of the cause through an online form. In an interview with The News-Letter, Alam shared that he came to the idea of renaming the Woodrow Wilson fellowship after Posner on the day of his funeral after hearing people discuss that an award or fellowship should be started to commemorate him. “Not only was [Posner] a Woodrow

Two and a half years ago, Nathan Connolly, a professor in the History Department, submitted a motion calling on Hopkins administrators to rename the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship in light of the former U.S. president’s racist legacy. Connolly — along with the Homewood Faculty Assembly, which voted to support his motion — is still waiting for an answer. “We put a referendum on the table in November 2016 to be voted by the Homewood Faculty Assembly about renaming the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship and establishing a committee to come up with a more suitable name,” he said. “We recognized that Wilson was no longer the namesake that we wanted applied to our most illustrious undergraduates, who were going on and doing research.” In recent years, several schools have struggled to contextualize and come to terms with their racist pasts. Many colleges and universities uncovered racist images of blackface and lynching in their

The Student Government Association (SGA) met for the second time this summer on June 30 over Zoom. At the meeting, SGA voted unanimously to support renaming the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship and Gildersleeve House of AMR II in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. The group also signed the petition calling for the University to permanently end its plans for the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD). Executive President Sam Mollin noted that the petition has over 6,000 signatures. On June 12, administrators decided to postpone the implementation of the JHPD for at least two years. “Instead of a two-year freeze, the petition is calling for a complete stop to the private police force,” he said. “I do not think it makes sense for the University to pursue this private police force when there are alternatives to policing that the University has chosen not to pursue.” Sophomore Class President Anthony Singleton

Research has been part of sophomore Ethan Posner’s life since high school, prompting him to dive deeper during his time at Hopkins. A Biophysics major, Posner is a member of the Fleming Lab, where he has investigated Outer Membrane Proteins (OMPs) for the past year and a half. Posner is a Woodrow Wilson Fellow, which provides up to $10,000 in research funding for three years of an undergraduate’s career. This has enabled him to dedicate his summers to research, and he plans to present at conferences in the near future. Before arriving at Hopkins, Posner studied neurodegenerative diseases at the New York Genome Center. His experience and the relationships he formed with his mentors there naturally led him to seek out research opportunities when he arrived at Hopkins. “I got involved in September of my freshman year — really right away — and that was because of my previous positive

 Hopkins community mourns the loss of Ethan Posner - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By AIMEE CHO                                                     | March 12, 2024
The University is mourning the loss of Ethan Posner, who passed away Friday, March 8 after a brief illness. He was a sophomore studying Biophysics at the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and a member of Hopkins Hillel, the Jewish Students Association, Club Swimming, the German Club and the Undergraduate Brain Computer Interface Society. Posner was also an active researcher at the Fleming Lab and a Woodrow Wilson Fellow. Last December, he shared his research experiences in an interview with The News-Letter. At the Fleming Lab, Posner examined SurA and its interactions with outer membrane proteins. He was interested in understanding the mechanisms behind such pathways in particular, because it could be used to develop new antibiotic therapies that target the studied interactions. As part of the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, Posner was dedicated to forming his three-year independent research project. Over the summer, he had begun planning experiments, writing

 TRU-UE overwhelmingly ratifies contract with the University - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By NICK DAUM                                                     | April 23, 2024
The Hopkins graduate student union, Teachers and Researchers United (TRU-UE), officially ratified their contract with the University on Thursday, April 18. The vote was nearly unanimous, with 99.5% of TRU-UE members agreeing to ratify the contract. TRU-UE had been negotiating with the Hopkins administration for over nine months. The two parties held over 40 unsuccessful negotiation sessions before coming to an agreement on March 29. According to TRU-UE’s website, the contract represented “historic wins setting a new standard for grad labor around the country!” The union is also currently issuing new digital membership cards following their announcement of the new contract. The contract includes several key provisions, which mainly regard pay and compensation for union members. This included a raise of the minimum stipend to $47,000 per year starting in July. This represents an overall increase of around 32% in stipends across all departments. In an email to The News-Letter,

The graduate student union, Teachers and Researchers United (TRU-UE), and the University reached a tentative bargaining agreement on Friday, March 29. After almost a year of negotiations, this tentative agreement covers several important articles, including raising the minimum stipend to $47,000 this July, with an additional one-time signing bonus of $1,000 upon ratification. In an email to the community, Provost Ray Jayawardhana and Vice Provost for Graduate and Professional Education Sabine Stanley called attention to the different aspects of the contract, including how the proposed stipend increase is a 40% on average increase across the bargaining unit and a 50% increase in some departments. "We are pleased to have reached an agreement on the first contract between the university and TRU-UE Local 197 and appreciate the constructive and collaborative spirit union leaders brought to the negotiations as we sought common ground on a wide range of important issues.

I initially had a bit of trouble trying to think of a concept or action that really resembles joy — especially during this quarantine period, it’s much easier to fall back to negative emotions and feelings. Eventually, I realized that what got me through these past nine months and brought joy into my life while I was physically isolated were the interactions I had with my friends online. Sounds pretty simple, right? In retrospect, it was actually really hard to even make the effort to reach out to my loved ones and spend meaningful time with them when my mind was also cluttered with intrusive thoughts about the many “what-ifs.” I was worried about my immediate family and COVID-19 infection, periods of job insecurity, my extended family in Puerto Rico and Colombia who are undoubtedly facing a similar and yet fundamentally different experience to me. It was easy to send

I watched as the USPS truck sped out of our sleepy cul-de-sac. I scurried up to the mailbox, flung open the lid and ripped open the letter. It was finally here, and I was in. I had been accepted to Duke University’s Talent Identification Program (TIP). I would get to spend three weeks of the summer on a college campus with other seventh graders. The only caveat was it was an educational camp, but that was the part I was most excited to experience: learning at a college with other kids my age. Most people at school laughed when I said I wanted to go to this summer camp, and I understood why. It was kind of nerdy. It wasn’t an outdoor adventure camp like the one featured in The Parent Trap, but I couldn’t wait for June to arrive. Before I knew it, I had loaded up my bag

Soon after quarantine began, I realized that I tended to run away from my negative emotions. I’d channel my anxiety into The News-Letter’s all-consuming, weekly production cycle. I’d hide my sadness by flitting about M-level. Bury my emptiness at Power Plant Live!. Manifest my stress through low-grade hypochondria. Suddenly, all my outlets were gone. The News-Letter became online-only and much less taxing. The library closed, Power Plant turned into skribbl.io and the only person for whom I could perform my existence became my then-boyfriend. Despite an unprecedented pandemic, my hypochondria mostly dissipated, though this was largely because I spent much of the spring and summer dissociating. I often felt disconnected from my body (and any of its symptoms), as if at any moment a giant hand in the sky could come down and yank me away. I think that many of us dissociated to some degree or another at the

You know that feeling when you look around Hop and feel incredibly detached from what life was like at home? Then your mind shifts back, and you remember your home friends, your family, your spot on the couch and that one food you love that just doesn’t taste the same in Baltimore (currently missing good pizza). It's a warm nostalgia trip that I think everyone experiences just a little bit. Every once in a while, I really crave that warmth of home, so I find an incredibly legal website to watch movies and throw on My Cousin Vinny. This movie is a staple in every Italian American household I know. The reason is probably Vinny. He is played by Joe Pesci, the uber-violent mobster in Goodfellas and the short robber in Home Alone. But here he plays a quintessential Brooklyn Italian. Vinny argues with everyone and their mother for an

For as long as I can remember, I have always loved to sing — when nobody’s around, that is. I frequently host late-night karaoke parties for one, wail in the shower like nobody hears me and hum in the kitchen when I’m alone. Music has always been my coping mechanism for dealing with stressful events; as a child, I found myself gravitating to the piano when I felt like no one understood me, but I always hid my singing until I knew I was alone in the house. I’m pretty sure my family knew, but for my sake they acted none the wiser. Over the years, I found several excuses to not pursue vocal lessons. On the surface, I justified this by affirming that sticking with piano was the right decision; I’d already invested seven years into training, and I couldn’t pursue both piano and vocal lessons. It didn’t help

A student achieves a major academic success, a young couple buys their dream home, a retiree escapes to a tropical haven. Each person feels elated, incandescently happy. Then a phenomenon called hedonic adaptation takes hold, and the wonderful feeling subsides over time. According to David Mercier, a Hopkins adjunct faculty member, happiness is not simply a temporary pleasurable stimulation of the senses. Mercier, along with fellow Hopkins adjunct faculty member and nutritionist Kelly Dorfman, has taught an Intersession course at Hopkins titled The Art and Science of Happiness since 2018. During this class Mercier and Dorfman ask their students to not see happiness as a transient state. As we develop emotionally, psychologically and spiritually, we acquire wisdom and maturity. In an interview with The News-Letter, they explained that, as a consequence of this development, we begin to orient ourselves toward happiness. “We want to redefine the definition of happiness to

My mom’s name is Ellyn Joy Weisfeldt Margulies. From the day she was born, she was stuck with joy being a part of her life whether she wanted it to be or not. As a consumer of mass media, I know that the classic response to such a prescriptive name would be to live in lifelong defiance of her so-called destiny, ultimately coming to begrudgingly accept the attribute that was bestowed upon her. But not my mom. With defiant fervor, my mom embraces joy as a defining principle. Her primary goals are living her life joyfully, bringing other people joy and looking to the future through a lens of joy. The word “joy” itself brings her joy. Seeing the movie Joyful Noise was an event for us when it came out. Whenever I walked into my parents’ room growing up, whether it was to share good news or bad, because

The University increased undergraduate gathering limits to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors, effective on March 31. Previously, these numbers were capped at five people indoors and 10 people for outdoor meetings. In an email to the student body, Provost Sunil Kumar and Vice Provost for Student Affairs Alanna Shanahan explained that COVID-19 cases have dramatically decreased since the spike last February. “New infections among students have remained in the low single digits per day, even as we have gradually loosened some of the restrictions imposed to prevent the virus’ spread,” they wrote. They emphasized that students still need to follow all other COVID-19 precautions. Students must wear masks and continue following social distancing protocols when gathering indoors.

Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer Jane Schlegel announced that the University will be offering COVID-19 vaccine clinics on campus in an email to the Hopkins community on May 18. Registration is open for the first clinic, which will be held in the Glass Pavillion on Thursday, May 20. Additionally, administrators updated the health guidelines for students and faculty staying in Baltimore over the summer in an email on May 14. Like in the spring semester, those on campus will need to complete a COVID-19 Health Check on Prodensity in order to access campus; however, students no longer need to register travel on Prodensity. Masks are only required indoors and outside when social distancing is not possible. According to the administrators, existing quarantine and isolation guidelines will remain in effect regardless of vaccination status.

Dear Class of ‘25, Congratulations on getting into Hopkins! We are so excited to finally resume a sense of normalcy this coming school year and welcome you on campus. However, with cases on the rise and new variants spreading, the fight against COVID-19 is not over. Here is a checklist of a few important University rules (as of Aug. 23) to keep in mind to best PROTECT JHU as everyone returns and begins a new year in-person: Prodensity First and foremost, everyone must download the Prodensity app, available on iOS and Android devices. Through the app, created solely for Hopkins affiliates, you will be able to submit the required daily health checks, receive COVID-19 test results and report COVID-19-related violations. The health checks, which must be completed every 12 hours, ask you to confirm that you have been compliant with all testing and vaccine protocols and have not been exposed

The University announced on Oct. 26 that food and drink will be permitted at outdoor events. Previously, only single-serving, grab-and-go options were permitted to mitigate risks of COVID-19 transmission. University administrators noted that this change came because of high COVID-19 vaccination rates on campus. According to the email sent to University constituents, events with fewer than 50 people do not need to be approved by the University regardless of whether or not food is being served. Pi Beta Phi’s Vice President of Risk Management Hannah Bruckheim was glad the policy changed, but wished the University provided more clarity and notice. “I’m glad that they’ve updated some of the policies in relation to risk because of lowering community transmission, but they did a really poor job of communicating these changes to student groups and making it clear when and how they’re taking effect,” she said.

University affiliates announced a surge in COVID-19 cases among graduate students in the past week in an email to the Hopkins community on Dec. 17. Despite this, the administrators affirmed that Hopkins will not be changing its current COVID-19 prevention protocols in their email. “We continue to see no evidence of COVID transmission in our classroom or research spaces. Case counts among undergraduates, faculty, and staff have stabilized after a brief uptick following the Thanksgiving holiday,” they wrote. While the majority of cases were reported to be from students in the School of Public Health, 52 of the 120 reported cases were from students in eight of the University’s other graduate schools. All of the cases, according to the University, were traced to off-campus social gatherings.

Hundreds of students, staff and community members gathered on campus last Friday to attend Lighting of the Quads, a long-upheld Hopkins tradition. The event was sponsored by the Parents Fund, Hopkins Dining and the Office of Leadership Engagement and Experiential Development, and over 4,000 guests registered to attend. Lighting of the Quads, which celebrates the conclusion of the fall semester and introduces the holiday season, is held annually. This year marks its 17th anniversary as well as a return to in-person celebration following last year’s virtual event. From 6 to 8 p.m., Hopkins organizations hosted activities in Keyser Quad, such as a selfie booth, DIY tote bag designing, and gingerbread house building. Guests lined up to take pictures with the holiday-themed backdrops and decorations present throughout the quad. Homewood Recycling, the Center for Social Concern, Athletics and the Life Design Lab were among the Hopkins associations present at the event.

Hopkins hosted its annual Lighting of the Quads (LOTQ) celebration on YouTube Live this past Saturday. LOTQ usually takes place each December shortly before finals; however, this year’s celebration marked many firsts — the first time the event went virtual, the first time it took place during the spring semester and the first time there was no live audience in the ordinary sense. For me, the celebration was a bittersweet occasion marked by many “lasts.” It was one last opportunity to score some Hopkins swag, one last chance to hear University President Ronald J. Daniels count down from 10 before turning on the lights around Gilman and, with Commencement plans still uncertain, potentially one last time that I would be able to bask in some Hopkins school spirit. Instead, my roommates and I watched LOTQ as we munched on homemade cinnamon rolls. Overall, I wasn’t disappointed. Like any LOTQ held

Yesterday, the University announced that Hopkins affiliates who work or study at its U.S. campuses will be required to get a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 booster shot by Feb. 1 Affiliates will need to upload documentation of their booster shot in the University’s Vaccine Management System. In interviews with The News-Letter, students expressed support for the mandate, and shared concerns about rising cases associated with the omicron variant. Freshman Katherine Burdinger endorsed the new booster requirement in an email to The News-Letter. “It's an extra precaution to keep everyone safe, which I think is what we have to continue to do as long as [COVID-19] is a danger,” she wrote. University administrators noted in the broadcast that people are eligible for booster shots six months after receiving a second shot of the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, or two months after a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine.

In an email to the Hopkins community on Jan. 14, the University announced several modifications to COVID-19 policies for the spring semester in response to the omicron variant. Masking Guidelines University mask guidelines have been updated to require the usage of N95s, KN95s or cloth masks worn over surgical masks. According to the administrators, a variety of types of masks will be distributed starting next week. “Whatever kind of University-approved mask you use, the most important thing is to wear it consistently and properly — with a tight fit and covering both the mouth and the nose,” they wrote. Senior Michael Lin expressed approval of the changes in masking policy and testing requirements, citing the University’s recently announced booster shot mandate. “I appreciate that they want us to double mask, but at the same time, masks are still resources and worth money, so when it gets better, it would be

In an email to the Hopkins community on Dec. 31, the University announced modifications to its COVID-19 policies for the spring 2022 semester due to the omicron variant. The email stated that, effective Jan. 4, all undergraduate and graduate students will have to get tested for COVID-19 at least twice a week, with at least 48 hours separating each test. This fall, vaccinated students were only required to get tested once a week and unvaccinated individuals had to get tested twice a week. Additionally, the University announced that those who test positive will be released from quarantine after five days if they show no symptoms; otherwise, they must remain in isolation. The University administrators explained that this policy change is in response to recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announcements. “This change follows recent guidance from the [CDC] and is made in consultation with our own experts in

In light of increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases rise around the country, the University announced on Dec. 22 that most Intersession classes have moved online and the majority of students will not be able to return to on-campus residence halls before Jan. 18. According to the University, in-person research and work will not be impacted by this change. Intersession classes are scheduled from Jan. 4 to Jan. 21 with spring classes beginning on Jan. 24. University administrators noted in their email that the changes to Intersession policy do not impact plans for the spring. “We are continuing our planning for our in-person spring semester, starting Jan. 24, and for normal research and other campus operations in the meantime,” they wrote.

Effective Feb. 7, the University lifted certain restrictions related to guest policies for residence halls and club and athletic events, citing low COVID-19 case counts on campus. According to an email sent by University officials last Friday, residential students are now allowed to invite Hopkins affiliates as guests overnight and to visit other residence halls. This change follows other relaxed COVID-19 guidelines; Last week, the University reopened indoor dining at half capacity. In the email, University officials expanded on their decision to only allow Hopkins affiliates as guests. “We will continue to restrict non-JHU affiliates at this time because we can’t be certain of their vaccination status or testing activities,“ they wrote. Vice President for Communications Andy Green explained the reasoning for loosening guest restrictions in an email to The News-Letter. “Hosting a guest in a dorm room does present some degree of additional risk, given that residential students are

In an email sent to the Hopkins community on Feb. 25, the University announced the loosening of enhanced COVID-19 safety protocols citing the local and national decrease in cases and hospitalizations as well as high vaccination and booster rates on campus. Effective immediately, students are no longer required to fill out the Prodensity health check every 12 hours to access campus, although University officials recommended that students keep the app for alerts. Students will also only be required to get a COVID-19 test once per week as opposed to twice. According to the administrators, this policy is expected to remain for the rest of the semester. In an email to The News-Letter, junior Raymond Perez shared that he believes these measures are appropriate given the dynamic nature of the pandemic. “​​I think the University's new COVID-19 policies are a step that is commendable given the trajectory of the pandemic,” he

This semester, the University has allowed the resumption of certain large in-person lecture classes, some with over 100 people, despite enhanced COVID-19 policies due to the Omicron variant. In an interview with The News-Letter, Applied Mathematics and Statistics Senior Lecturer Mario Micheli explained that in the fall semester, classes of over 50 had to be held online and classes of 49 or below had the option to be taught in person. Micheli reflected on why he chose to teach in person this semester. “I really feel uncomfortable when I teach online to ask my students to turn on their camera,” he said. “I see their bed with their stuffed animals... I feel like I’m intruding on their private life. If I don’t ask them to turn on their cameras, it’s way harder to engage with them.” Micheli also noted that there was a larger standard deviation in his assessment results

Over winter break, the University made multiple updates to its COVID-19 policies, including upgrading its masking requirements, implementing twice-weekly COVID-19 testing and reducing isolation periods to five days for those asymptomatic on the fifth day. Recently, the University announced that affiliates must also test negative for COVID-19 in order to leave isolation on the fifth day. In interviews with The News-Letter, faculty members and students shared their opinions on the beginning of the semester. Anna Durbin, professor of international health and director of the Center for Immunization Research, expressed her trust in the University’s guidelines for the in-person spring. “The University has tracked COVID cases very efficiently and has worked diligently to try to reduce the spread of COVID on campus, and that included a vaccine and booster mandate,” she said. “Recently, with information coming out from CDC, the encouragement and requirement for affiliates to wear KN95s and N95s coupled

The University announced modifications to its COVID-19 policies for the spring semester in response to the low number of positive tests in the first week of students returning to campus in an email to the Hopkins community on Sunday. The modifications include resuming in-person dining and requiring a negative COVID-19 test before leaving quarantine. Indoor dining started operating at 50% capacity at the Fresh Food Cafe, Nolan’s and Peabody Dining on Jan. 31 and will resume at Levering Kitchens on Feb. 7. The email acknowledged that certain safety precautions must stay in place while eating. “We know that eating is also a time to socialize and catch up with friends. We ask that you be vigilant and only remove your mask while actually eating and to put your mask back on if you continue to socialize,” administration wrote. “You should also distance while unmasked, by sitting only at the designated

The University welcomed the majority of students back on campus during Move-In Weekend from Jan. 21 – 23. Due to a nationwide surge in COVID-19 cases largely caused by the spread of the Omicron variant, the University moved Intersession online, with some exceptions granted for those engaged in research and select in-person programs. Students who arrived last weekend were required to take a rapid test and a standard saliva PCR test upon arrival and were only allowed into dorms if they received a negative result on their rapid test. Those who arrived outside of testing hours were required to quarantine in their rooms until they were able to get tested. The change in move-in guidelines forced some students to change travel plans. Freshman Tinu Owolabi shared her experience with this in an email to The News-Letter. “I had to push my ticket back significantly, which meant we lost some money,”

Beginning March 19, the University’s guest policies for on-campus housing will extend to allow non-affiliate guests. This policy change comes after the lifting of other restrictions as a result of high vaccination and booster rates on campus. Once these policies are in effect, residents can host both University affiliates and non-affiliates. Currently, only affiliates are allowed as guests. Students will be limited to a maximum of three guests per residential unit and all guests may stay for up to 72 hours. They must be signed in with a government-issued ID and remain with the student at all times. In an email to The News-Letter, Vice President for Communications Andrew Green wrote that the University shifted this policy in response to positive developments in public health conditions. “The decision to allow non-affiliate guests in residence halls was made in recognition of decreased COVID rates on campus and in the community, and

In two email broadcasts sent to affiliates on Mar. 9, the University announced relaxations of the indoor masking policy for vaccinated affiliates and a spring break travel testing requirement. Effective immediately, masks are no longer required in administrative spaces, public events, research labs, athletic facilities, libraries, residence halls and other public nonclassroom communal spaces. Masks will continue to be required in classroom spaces, except for instructors who can maintain a 6-foot distance from others. Freshman Resham Talwar wrote in an email to The News-Letter that she is nervous about a rise in cases after spring break. “I feel like this policy works for now but if the influx in cases after spring break is anything like the influx in cases after Intersession, we’re signing ourselves up for major chaos by relaxing the policy,” she wrote. “For now, it certainly is nice to be sitting in the Brody Learning Commons and

When we mention to people back home that we go to Hopkins, many of us are asked if we want to be doctors. While it is true that pre-med culture is prominent on campus and Hopkins is renowned for its medical institution, the University is strengthening its reputation of academic excellence in the social sciences. On Friday, Oct. 6, University President Ronald J. Daniels announced the new School of Government and Policy located at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg Center at 555 Pennsylvania Avenue in D.C. The school will open by the fall of 2026 and will offer graduate and doctorate degrees focusing on domestic policy. This new venture is the latest in the University’s encouragement of academic discourse around civic responsibility. The Stavros Niarchos Foundation (SNF) Agora Institute recently unveiled a new minor in Civic Life, with a focus on strengthening the capacity for civic engagement among individuals from

If you’ve been following the news this week, you’ve likely seen Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce’s rumored relationship front and center. Following her appearance at his football game, fans have been analyzing short clips of the two interacting in an attempt to piece together the details of their relationship. Even senators are speculating on how well-matched the two are. Obviously, most people commenting on their relationship do not personally know Swift or Kelce beyond their carefully curated public presences. The craze surrounding them and Swift’s previous romances indicates a parasocial relationship between the public and the pop star. Teen Vogue defines a parasocial relationship as a “long-term attachment to a media figure (a blogger, an idol or even a politician) based on what a person ‘knows’ or understands about that figure over time.” Parasocial relationships have existed long before Swifties. In the 1960s, The Beatles

The News-Letter published an op-ed last week titled “The Israel-Hamas war is not too complicated for Hopkins students,” which took a pro-Israel stance on the conflict. Following its publication, The News-Letter and the article’s author received backlash for its lack of historical context on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The News-Letter is receptive to criticism of our journalistic practices and takes student concerns about our decision to publish the op-ed seriously. We want to clarify that all Hopkins affiliates are invited to submit op-eds to The News-Letter, and an op-ed is not reflective of the views of The News-Letter or its staff as a whole. At the time of the op-ed’s publication, we had only published one perspective on the conflict. The News-Letter understands that this created a skewed representation of Hopkins students' opinions. Our Opinions Editor solicited pieces on the conflict from the hundreds of Hopkins affiliates on the Opinions section

Nearly a week has passed, and the student sit-in at Garland Hall continues. Occasionally the protestors will walk out with their megaphone as students head to class, chanting, among other things, “No Justice, No Peace! No Private Police!” This past Friday, I encountered the group as they came to Levering Kitchens, hoping to garner support in their condemnation of the University. A lot of my fellow students and friends are against the Community Safety and Strengthening Act, the bill that will authorize Hopkins to create a private police force. I’ve seen numerous Facebook posts and events, fliers around campus and protests. I’ve seen pieces in The News-Letter expressing opposition to the bill. I will never restrict my fellow citizens’ ability to protest against perceived injustice and to demand a redress of grievances, and I have a lot of respect for my peers for standing up for their beliefs.

In response to “The Israel-Hamas war is not too complicated for Hopkins students” published October 18, 2023: Recently, the News-Letter published “The Israel-Hamas war is not too complicated for Hopkins students.” Before proceeding, this will not be the average response that one might expect to an article like this. I will not be arguing the “pro-Palestine” position; as, although the article I respond to argues a pro-Israel position under the guise of arguing the conflict is not too complicated for Hopkins students, I would rather address the question originally presented. Indeed, the fact that students at the top university in the country disagree on the morality of the Israel-Palestine conflict should clue you in on the notion that the conflict is complicated. If we were all agreeing, I might be more amenable to this proposition. Yet, students are disagreeing. The idea that if we just understood Hamas to be anti-Semitic,

The Stavros Niarchos Foundation (SNF) Agora Institute is introducing two new programs of study to Hopkins through the Center for Economy and Society (CES): a minor in Civic Life and a major in Moral and Political Economy (MPE). While the minor in Civic Life has become available to all Hopkins students starting during this fall of 2023, the MPE major will only be offered to the sophomore cohort of next year, with its class size capped at approximately 20 students. The Civic Life minor focuses on educating students on political institutions and international studies, taking an interdisciplinary approach to social change. It will incorporate “critical reflection, ethical thinking, empirical understanding, historical perspectives and action for social change.” The website also states that the area of civic studies will have a specific focus on the examination of skills that are foundational to liberal democracies and pluralistic societies, as well as the

If you ask Hopkins students about what is going on between Israel and Hamas, a common answer you’ll receive is, “It’s complicated.” What’s weird is that this refrain is all that so many people have to say, and that doesn’t quite sit right with me. Can some of the brightest students in the world not wrap their head around it? We are working on some of the most complicated issues in pandemic response, robotic surgery and U.S. politics, to name a few. When else has the complexity of a problem stopped Hopkins students? Is it really that complicated? I don’t think so. Every Hopkins student has learned how to break down problems into manageable parts and chip away at them. Whether it is the engineering or humanities classes, a core part of the Hopkins education is learning how to identify problems, isolate variables and use our critical thinking skills to

President Ronald J. Daniels announced the new Johns Hopkins University School of Government and Policy (SGP) in a University-wide broadcast on Oct. 6. The school will be the first new academic division at Hopkins since 2007. “The school will build upon the foundation of Johns Hopkins University’s nearly 150 years of leadership in research and discovery... to research and develop innovative, data-driven approaches to contemporary policy challenges and effective government,” Daniels wrote in the broadcast. SGP will make its home at the recently opened Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg Center at 555 Pennsylvania Avenue in D.C. (the Hopkins Bloomberg Center), where the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) is also located. It will provide avenues for students and faculty to contribute to data-driven research, debate and analysis in public policy.

Last month, faculty, staff and students moved into the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg Center at 555 Pennsylvania Avenue (the Hopkins Bloomberg Center) in D.C., which will serve as the new home of the University’s School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). The 10-story steel and glass building features 38 classrooms, multi-purpose study lounges, a public art gallery and a 375-seat theater. In a broadcast email, President Ronald J. Daniels expressed his excitement about the new center at 555 Pennsylvania Avenue and expounded on its functionality. “We will host distinguished scholars and global leaders, hold convenings and workshops and mount performances by the Peabody Institute,” he wrote. “If you haven’t visited yet, I hope that you will take advantage of the many opportunities to do so.” For students intending to take on civic studies, the Hopkins Bloomberg Center provides ample spaces conducive to academic pursuits.

As the world watches on and argues about who or what to condemn that led us to this reality where thousands have been killed in Gaza with no ceasefire in sight, we must ask ourselves what we would like to happen. Do we just want a world of retaliation and retribution, or do we desire a meaningful solution? As members of the Hopkins community, we need to ask ourselves: What should be the goal when addressing global conflicts? Is it retribution, or is it resolution? If a so-called "solution" results in more harm and destruction than the problem it intended to solve, is it still a solution, or has it become a part of the problem? The media, political activists and politicians are all shoving opinions down our throats, telling us who is to blame and what is to be condemned, while governments move to restrict freedom of speech.

It’s officially that time of year. It’s college admissions season, and many high school students are whittling down their college lists and submitting applications. In the last decade, college admissions have only become more competitive, especially at top universities like Hopkins. The University’s acceptance rate has substantially decreased from 20.4% in 2010 to 7% in recent years. We’re here today because we beat the odds. But, what now? On Sidechat, in Brody Cafe and in between classes, students complain that college life at Hopkins isn’t quite what they had imagined. We attribute this to a variety of factors, including the lack of school spirit, possible grade deflation, extensive campus construction and the lack of social spaces on campus. While it is true that the construction on campus undeniably impacts our daily lives, it’s crucial to acknowledge that we cannot place all the blame for our problems on the University. Some

This November, we’re seeing more men around campus growing mustaches. While you might assume that the CVS Pharmacy on St. Paul Street has stopped stocking razors, it’s actually for Movember, an annual month-long push to raise awareness for men’s health issues — including prostate cancer, testicular cancer and suicide — by sporting mustaches. Although males make up 50% of the population, they contribute to nearly 80% of suicides, and male depression often goes undiagnosed. Men can be more reluctant to seek help for mental health issues than those of other gender identities, and this is especially true for college-aged men. While there’s no difference in the number of male and female college students who report mental health issues, females are about 20% more likely to pursue help. Men are also less likely to have close friends to turn to for support. Although Movember focuses on men’s mental health, people of

The Johns Hopkins Hospital has opened an investigation into Dr. Darren Klugman for posting violent anti-Palestinian tweets. Klugman is the Pediatric Cardiac Critical Care Director at the Johns Hopkins Pediatric and Congenital Heart Center and an Associate Professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The posts, published on Oct. 7 and 8 on social media platform X, previously Twitter, used hateful and racist language. In one post, Klugman commented “G-d willing” in response to a user’s concern about “large scale slaughter” in Palestine. In another, he wrote that “Israel has no peace partner w the Palestinians. Barbaric animals w no concern for life.” The posts gained public attention on Nov. 12, and the University and Hospital acknowledged the tweets on Nov. 16. Klugman has now been placed on leave while the tweets are investigated. Two Hopkins physicians reported a culture of fear among doctors, staff and patients in

As we enter the last month of fall semester classes, students will inevitably hunker down in the library while they prepare for exams and frantically type out papers. Typically, The News-Letter reminds students to leave the library and enjoy the sunlight; we tell students to prioritize their mental health and take breaks from continuous studying. Although that still holds true, we would like to highlight the importance of the Milton S. Eisenhower (MSE) library to this campus and its students. The University’s MSE Modernization Project will involve closing MSE down for an estimated two and a half years, beginning in summer 2024. Although talks of MSE’s renovation are not new, the start of this project is approaching rapidly, and students are anxious about finding alternative study spaces on campus.

As part of the second phase of its reopening plan, Hopkins opened several on-campus spaces to be used for small in-person gatherings and study spaces in early February. Despite initial delays due to a COVID-19 spike and snowstorms, the Milton S. Eisenhower (MSE) Library, Brody Learning Center, Hutzler Reading Room (HUT), large tent in the Freshman Quad and smaller temporary outdoor structures around campus have opened with limited hours. Freshman Elaina Regier believes the University should provide more spaces for group work. “There are only two study rooms in Brody with a capacity of more than one person,” she said. “I’m a lot more comfortable working with other people in a private study space than in one of the public spaces.” Likewise, freshman Lauren Zou commented on some of the negative impacts of the de-densification measures. “Brody is a very collaborative space, but because of COVID, there’s barely any talking

The Student Government Association (SGA) unanimously passed a contact tracing resolution and discussed University programming for the hybrid semester during its weekly meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 23. Senior Class Senator JJ Tie introduced the Contact Tracing Resolution in response to the COVID-19 outbreak among on-campus undergraduates in early February. According to Tie, the resolution sets the stage for further discussion about increasing contact tracing measures to improve public health outcomes for the University community. “It is just a starting point for the admin to incorporate contact tracing into Prodensity,” she said. An earlier version of the resolution made specific references to the COVID-19 contact tracing app NOVID, but all mentions of NOVID were removed to allow for greater flexibility in how the University approaches contact tracing. During the discussion on this resolution, Executive President Sam Mollin called for greater specificity throughout the resolution to clarify its purpose and scope. Rather

Thousands of students participated in the University’s first-ever virtual Student Involvement Fair (SIF) from Sept. 3 to Sept. 5. Through the event, interested students talked to representatives from over 300 student organizations through Zoom and chat messages. Freshman Gabe Gormezano, who attended SIF, stated that he was very pleased with the online experience. “It was pretty comparable [to an in-person event] in terms of getting the information and getting to register for clubs,” he said. “It was definitely the best alternative that could have been done, given our current circumstances.” SIF was held Thursday from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., Friday from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. and Saturday from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m on CampusGroups. Director of Student Leadership and Involvement Calvin L. Smith, Jr., who organized the event, explained in an email to The News-Letter that SIF was purposefully held at varied times in order to make

 Hoptoberfest concert plagued by technical issues, but very fun while it lasted - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

Hoptoberfest — what all of us freshmen have heard was a relaxing, fun-filled way to welcome autumn, get free T-shirts and meet new people — looked a little different this year. Instead of the usual in-person experience, we had a week of virtual events to look forward to, culminating in the annual Hoptoberfest concert on Friday, Oct. 9. Promised to feature “one of the biggest to ever perform for Hopkins” by the Hoptoberfest co-chairs, I was pretty hyped at the idea of some good music to end my week. In fact, the concert was just in time to, for lack of a better word, celebrate the end of my first round of midterms and inject a good dose of a much-needed destresser into my schedule. Better yet, the co-chairs didn’t disappoint: They brought in Quinn XCII as the artist, along with an interactive Q&A session. My hopes were high as

Hoptoberfest, an annual festival by a student organization of the same name, was held virtually for the first time ever from Monday, Oct. 5 to Friday, Oct. 9. The events, intended to relieve stress and celebrate the start of autumn, featured activities including concerts, a baking class and a virtual zoo. In an email to The News-Letter, junior Trifeena James reported that she enjoyed Hoptoberfest’s attempts to create an online experience. “While this year was different, I still appreciate the efforts of the organizing board with setting up the events so that the Hopkins community could still come together on a virtual platform,” she wrote. “It's always great to see different members of the community come together outside of an academic setting.” Hoptoberfest Co-Chair Isaac Lucas explained that holding the festival virtually presented unique challenges to his team, who were not expecting the fall semester to be entirely online. “When

The Student Government Association (SGA) held its weekly general body meeting on Oct. 24. During the meeting, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Ellen Chow and Vice Provost for Admissions & Financial Aid David Phillips presented updates about changes in the University’s admissions process due to the recent Supreme Court case that eliminated affirmative action in college admissions. Vice President Jackson Morris informed SGA members that from his recent meeting with The Center for Diversity & Inclusion, he learned that the opening of the Hopkins Student Center will be delayed to summer 2025. SGA is working with the administration to find large indoor study spaces, considering both the Student Center and the Milton S. Eisenhower Library will be under construction. Morris also mentioned the possibility of asking for a tuition reduction as significant parts of the campus are missing.

In light of the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) ruling against consideration of racial background in the college admissions process, the University sent a broadcast email to the Hopkins community on June 29. The broadcast denounced the ruling and affirmed the University’s continued commitment to diversity. In the email, University President Ronald J. Daniels acknowledged the structures in place that have historically obstructed the path to higher education for students of different backgrounds. He described the SCOTUS decision as a setback in constructing a diverse university community and further recognized the advantages that such a community brings. “We know that a diverse student body enriches the educational experience and better equips our students to assume the responsibilities of citizenship,” the broadcast stated. “There is no doubt that the success we have enjoyed in ensuring full participation of underrepresented students is jeopardized by this decision.” Students for Fair Admissions

Editor’s Note: This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available. The Johns Hopkins Hospital has opened an investigation into anti-Palestinian posts by Dr. Darren Klugman, Pediatric Cardiac Critical Care Director at the Johns Hopkins Pediatric and Congenital Heart Center and Associate Professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). The tweets in question are a series of posts and comments made from Klugman’s personal X account @DrKlugs on Oct. 8, following the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7. In his tweets, Klugman referred to Palestinians as “blood thirsty morally depraved animals” and “a people that rape and murder civilians." Klugman also promoted violence and denounced those who have asked for moderation or peace, calling “to reclaim every inch of Israel for Jews."

As the end of semester approaches and we close out 2023, it is important to reflect back on the various shifts that have occurred in the University’s academic landscape. In our final editorial of the year, we review the pleasant surprises and disappointing setbacks we’ve seen from Hopkins in 2023. This year, Hopkins grappled with major changes, most notably the end of affirmative action by the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS). Later this month, students admitted to the Class of 2028 through Early Decision I will mark the first major cohort of Blue Jays accepted in accordance with the new policy. Despite the SCOTUS ruling, we are optimistic that Hopkins is committed to creating a class that represents a range of backgrounds and identities. The News-Letter applauds the University’s decision to partner with QuestBridge, a national nonprofit that matches low-income students with top-ranked universities providing full four-year scholarships.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing higher education, but as we integrate ChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAI, into our classrooms, we must also consider the ethical implications. Privacy, accountability, and the student-teacher dynamic are all at stake. It's crucial that we take responsibility for ensuring the responsible use of this powerful technology, before it's too late. Surprise! That first paragraph wasn’t actually written by The News-Letter Editorial Board (eagle-eyed readers may have spotted the Oxford comma). It was generated by ChatGPT — and this is exactly what has professors worried. The AI tool — released in November by OpenAI, a Microsoft-backed AI research and deployment company — has an uncanny ability to mimic human behavior. It can compose songs, message Tinder matches and generate real estate listing descriptions. What’s troubling educators is that ChatGPT can also write essays, take the SAT and answer physics questions. As a result, some

Due to several recent cheating incidents during last semester's finals period, the administration is working to revise exam policies to prevent future occurrences. The administration is considering blocking access to the Internet on public computers and WebCT during final examination hours to prevent students from accessing class notes following incidents of cheating in the Environment and Your Health exam and ongoing scrutiny of student actions during the biochemistry exam. Two separate incidents of cheating were reported to the professor and teaching assistants for the Environment and Your Health test. Some students reportedly brought miniature cheat sheets concealed under their extensive amounts of clothing while some put cheat sheets on the floor near their desk to look at during the test. During the exam, some students also requested permission to go to the bathroom and accessed the Internet with their cell phones or the public computers outside the testing room in

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts are an essential component of university campuses, championed as a way to increase diversity, foster community and engender inclusivity. However, DEI has recently become a subject of attack by politicians. In early February of this year, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced his intention to dismantle DEI initiatives statewide. He seems to be using the Manhattan Institute’s recently released model legislation which details ways to “reform” public universities: abolishing DEI bureaucracies, removing mandatory diversity training, curtailing political coercion and ending identity-based preferences. Many conservative lawmakers and political activists view DEI as a thinly-veiled way of promoting “reverse bias.” Though Hopkins is not a public university, DeSantis’ staunch commitment to the demolition of DEI programs serves as an important reminder that diversity and inclusivity is not guaranteed, and there is more work to be done to create opportunities for diversity within academia.

The University released the Ten for One draft, a document detailing 10 goals that Hopkins seeks to achieve by the end of 2030, on April 14. The Ten for One framework follows Ten by Twenty, the 2013 framework which outlined priorities to guide the University through 2020. The University has checked in on these goals through three progress reports and a final report card in 2020. As students, we wanted to look back at Ten by Twenty and evaluate whether Hopkins has achieved its goals set a decade ago. Below are our assessments of some of the University’s past objectives: Goal 1: Selectively invest in programs that support our core academic mission. The wording of this goal is vague enough that Hopkins is able to check the box in any way it sees fit. The University did not present an action plan, give suggestions on what programs would be created

We’ve heard a lot of Hopkins Seven jokes over the past week, and they have nothing to do with D-level. The recently released 2022-2023 U.S. News & World Report college rankings place Hopkins at seventh among national universities — a jump from last year’s ninth. The annual rankings always spark conversation around campus. Over the last decade, Hopkins has gradually climbed to the top 10 and is continuing to rise through the ranks. We understand Blue Jays’ excitement over number seven — Hopkins hasn’t been ranked so highly since 1999. But we wonder what this ranking even means. Is Hopkins now better than Duke but still worse than Harvard? Was Hopkins substantially worse when it ranked 14th in 1998 than when it ranked seventh in 1999? Regardless, some schools have gone to drastic lengths to preserve their spot at the top. Columbia University was absent from the top of U.S

In its annual survey of colleges and universities, U.S. News and World Report ranked the Johns Hopkins University as the 16th-best doctoral university in the nation. This puts the school one spot lower than in last year's rankings. U.S. News editors and Hopkins admissions officers agreed that the change in the University's ranking this year meant very little. "Movement between 15 and 16 really is an insignificant movement, and there really isn't much different between 15 and 16 from one year to next," said Robert Morse, Director of Data Research at U.S. News. Hopkins Director of Admissions Information Systems Sam McNair called the change "kind of unremarkable" and said that it was "not a big story." He also said that there was no major difference between the number of applications received two years ago, when Hopkins was ranked No. 7, and the number of applications received last year. McNair added

After falling to number 11 last year, Hopkins has reclaimed its number ten spot in the 2019 U.S. News & World Report National University Rankings. Being a top ten school is something our University holds in high regard, publishing it proudly on The Hub and delivering the news to every student’s inbox. It is even listed as the fourth goal in University President Ronald J. Daniels’ Ten by Twenty plan. However, we would like to ask: Why does being a top ten university matter so much, and what does it really mean? The methodology for university rankings varies every year, but according to the U.S. News & World Report website, the organization factored in the University’s high average freshman retention rate of 97 percent, smaller class sizes and the level of per-student spending (the money a school spends on instruction, research, student services and related educational expenditures) in determining its

The second Commission on Undergraduate Education (CUE2), a group of faculty, staff, alumni and current undergraduates, has been working since April to evaluate the state of undergraduate education at Hopkins. CUE2 is charged with developing a report on the values of an undergraduate experience and identifying the key qualities that should define a Hopkins education. An initial report is expected by the end of fall 2018 with a second feedback period before the final report is released. The commission is co-chaired by Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Dean Beverly Wendland and Whiting School of Engineering Dean Ed Schlesinger. University President Ronald J. Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar convened CUE2 as a part of the “Ten by Twenty” plan. Assistant Vice Provost of Education Janet Schreck, who is a member of the commission, said that it is too early for CUE2 to identify any final recommendations. Schreck addressed the need

Nine months after its draft recommendations were released, the Task Force on Student Mental Health and Well-being published its final report on Thursday detailing specific ways that the University can improve mental health on campus. The Task Force was composed of students, faculty and staff from all nine divisions. The report recommends that the University promote a climate of support, increase student access to mental health services and provide mental health awareness training to students, faculty and staff. In addition to its recommendations, the report includes information about University mental health services as well as data from the 2016 Enrolled Student Survey. Out of the 16,014 students who received a survey, 14.1 percent responded. The data compares mental health at Hopkins with that of peer institutions. Fifty-eight percent of students reported feeling overwhelmed “often or very often.” A majority of students indicated that at least occasionally, they were so overwhelmed

This year’s SGA executive election is essentially uncontested. Three out of four positions have a single candidate running, and only two candidates are running for the position of Executive President. The New Horizons ticket — comprised of Noh Mebrahtu for Executive President, AJ Tsang for Executive Vice President, Mi Tu for Executive Treasurer and Aspen Williams for Executive Secretary — is currently running against Jessup Jong, who is vying for Executive President. After speaking with all the candidates, we are pleased that they are all passionate about the wellbeing of the student body and shaping the direction that the school can take in the coming years. That being said, we fully endorse the New Horizons ticket. Mebrahtu, Tsang and Tu are all incumbent candidates. They bring valuable experience from their years in the SGA, which they will apply to the next term. Williams, though currently a freshman senator, has shown

APRIL FOOL’S: This article was published as part of The News-Letter’s annual April Fool’s edition, an attempt at adding some humor to a newspaper that is normally very serious about its reporting. The Virginity Club launched a newly-revamped Hopkins Twelve contest on March 30. It is a pandemic-friendly sequel to the original Hopkins Seven, which challenges students to have sex in several designated locations across campus. Virginity Club president Gildersleeve Griffin-Hollander explained that the challenge was originally designed to dissuade Hopkins students from seeing sex as an enjoyable activity. “In a normal year, we don’t have to worry about students hooking up, because it just doesn’t happen,” Griffin-Hollander said. “But now it’s been a year since anyone has even pretended they could get some. Temptation is rising, and with more students getting vaccinated, we’re afraid fewer students will be virgins than ever before.” According to a Student Government Association (SGA)

Teachers and Researchers United (TRU) — affiliated with United Electrical Radio, and Machine Workers (UE) — has achieved a historic milestone. Last week, after more than four years of organizing, Hopkins graduate students voted to unionize with a resounding 97% majority. TRU was founded in 2014 to call for improved working conditions for Hopkins graduate students. At the time, unionization was not an option. It wasn’t until a 2016 ruling by the National Labor Relations Board that graduate-employee unions became legal at private universities. In 2018, TRU announced its intention to unionize Hopkins PhD students. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, TRU repeatedly advocated for graduate students. The group called on the University to provide more financial assistance, increase health and safety measures in graduate research and support students whose research was delayed by the pandemic. The demands that TRU has been fighting for since 2014 aren’t unreasonable in

Teachers and Researchers United (TRU) announced their intent to unionize graduate workers at the Stand Up, Speak Out rally on Wednesday, Sept. 26. TRU members are seeking to unionize because as students, they are not granted the same rights and benefits as other University employees. Hopkins community members gathered around the Milton S. Eisenhower (MSE) Library steps to listen to graduate students, security guards and nurses from the Hopkins Hospital discuss their roles and experiences working for the University. TRU’s movement is part of a larger national trend at private universities to increase graduate student representation through unionizing. Currently, New York University (NYU) is the only private institution with a graduate student union recognized by the federal government. However, Brandeis University and Tufts University, among others, have chosen to voluntarily recognize their graduate student unions. In an open letter signed by 201 graduate teachers and researchers, TRU called on the

For years, members of the Teachers and Researchers United (TRU), a graduate student organization, have called on the University to recognize them as an official union. Since the start of the pandemic, the need for this has become increasingly clear. Over the past 11 months, the University has failed to adequately support its graduate students, despite their crucial role in our institution’s functioning. In May, graduate students raised concerns about funding from the University but received little assurance that the administration was working to provide equitable protections during the pandemic. Many graduate students have suffered mental and financial insecurity in the past year and feel as though the University is prioritizing its bottom line over the health, wellbeing and education of its community. In response to requests for financial assistance, the University directed graduate students to seek support within their individual departments. TRU has found this effort to be insufficient

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) proposed a rule on Sept. 23 which, if it passes, will prevent graduate students from being considered employees of their university. In October, Teachers and Researchers United (TRU), an unofficial Hopkins graduate student union, started a petition opposing the proposed rule. TRU member Joanna Behrman, a History of Science and Technology graduate student who helped write the petition, stated that around 180 members of the Hopkins community have signed it to date. Behrman explained that recognizing graduate students as employees allows them federal protections from possible administrative retaliation that the proposed rule would take away. “Graduate students should be protected and shouldn’t be retaliated against, for example, for bringing up issues of lab safety with their supervisor,” she said. “This doesn’t mean that Hopkins will immediately decide that, ‘Well, now that it doesn’t have federal protection, we can retaliate all we want to.’ But

While Hopkins boasts a “tradition of employment excellence,” recent protests demonstrate that current employees disagree with that assessment. On Oct. 25, the unofficial graduate student union Teachers and Researchers United (TRU) gathered on Keyser Quad to call for fair wages and to hold a union card drive. Employed graduate students have argued they do not receive a living wage, due to inflation and the increasing cost of living. The University can decide to formally recognize TRU as a union at any moment based on evidence of majority support, and doing so would strengthen the relationship between Hopkins and its graduate students. On Nov. 3, food service workers protested in front of the Homewood Campus for job security. Represented by the Unite Here Local 7 union, dining employees have been negotiating a contract with the University since December. This past summer, the University switched from its dining vendor, Bon Appetit Management

Since the onset of the pandemic, the University has continued to prioritize its own financial health over the needs of the people it exists to support. In 2020, the University implemented austerity measures to mitigate projected financial losses due to COVID-19. The measures, which included suspending employer retirement contributions, furloughing staff and enacting hiring restrictions, directly impacted students, faculty and employees with little warning. Despite this projection, the University’s endowment flourished during the last fiscal year, growing by roughly $2.5 billion. Of course, the University wasn’t the only one worried about its finances at the onset of COVID-19. Unemployment increased dramatically during the pandemic, and close to 40% of all households in the U.S. reported facing financial hardships. During a global emergency that impacted all of its constituents, Hopkins chose to maintain its endowment at the expense of employees and students. Many are left wondering why the endowment fund was

Changes to vaccine guidelines is just one of the recent announcements increasing students’ anxieties due to the lack of communication from the University, leaving many still wanting more transparency from the Hopkins administration. Just a week before students arrived on campus, international students were informed that they would have to be re-vaccinated with a FDA-approved vaccine, while peer institutions have not required the same. Hopkins itself recognized the lack of controlled studies on the matter, providing little to no support for international students. While the University has set up a comprehensive COVID-19 dashboard for students to receive information, the administration often fails to meet its own deadlines in providing policy updates to the student body. Vague timelines and the lack of clear reasoning behind decisions have ultimately made students feel indifferent and isolated from the university’s decision-making processes. We acknowledge that the University has been better at broadcasting information; however,

“Maybe what we have to be doing is communicating more effectively why we haven’t made a decision, what the factors are that are going to go into that decision,” University President Ronald J. Daniels said in an interview with The News-Letter at the end of April. “Maybe that’s a way to deal with this new normal of pretty profound uncertainty across a number of our operations.” Maybe? Definitely. Daniels had suggested that, going forward, administrators might communicate with students while they were in the process of making a decision, instead of only after reaching one. Yet on August 6, after over a month of silence, Daniels and other University leaders announced that Hopkins would be online-only for the fall semester. To be clear, we do not condemn this decision; it was the responsible one to make. As the email noted, the daily rate of new coronavirus (COVID-19) infections in Baltimore

In an interview with The News-Letter on Wednesday, University President Ronald J. Daniels stated that Hopkins will “almost certainly” apply for the $3.1 million of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding available to it. “We regard that as a responsibility that we have to apply for that funding and to provide that funding to our students with financial need,” he said. “Given that those funds have been earmarked for our students, we’re anxious to be able to secure those funds and to get them out to our students.” The CARES Act funding is meant to provide emergency financial-aid grants for students experiencing hardship related to the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Daniels explained that these grants will not substitute but instead supplement existing emergency aid from the University. The University is still deliberating with legal counsel, he said, over whether or not to apply for the second

University leaders announced the creation of the Diverse Names and Narratives Project in an email to the student body on April 30. The task force aims to uplift the work of underrepresented individuals by making recommendations for renaming Charles Commons, the Undergraduate Teaching Labs and the Hopkins Outpatient Center buildings. The project is part of the University’s efforts to improve diversity and inclusion on campus. In the email, University President Ronald J. Daniels, CEO of Johns Hopkins Medicine and Dean of the Medical Faculty Paul B. Rothman and President of the Johns Hopkins Health System Kevin Sowers acknowledged that the Committee to Establish Principles on Naming (CEPN) recently released its draft report on renaming principles and explained that the University expects to move forward with the committee’s recommendations by June. However, the administration stressed that more progress is needed. “We believe it is incumbent upon us to move forward on

The Committee to Establish Principles on Naming released a draft report for feedback on April 6. The report contains guidelines under consideration for renaming, de-naming and the future naming of campus facilities, scholarships and programs whose titles may be tied to racism or inequality. University President Ronald J. Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar had announced the formation of the committee last July as part of the University’s 2020 Task Force to review the 2016 Roadmap on Diversity and Inclusion. The committee’s 22 members include administrators, faculty members, students and trustees. Junior Adelle Thompson, the sole undergraduate on the committee, emphasized that the resolutions do not solve the University’s history of racism and discrimination. “The resolutions offered are meant to be starting points. These aren’t end-all-be-all solutions to the pain of past prejudices and injustices against people of color,” she said. “They’re meant to be the beginning of change being made

The University announced it would form the Committee to Establish Principles on Naming last July as part of its Diversity and Inclusion initiative. The committee is charged with developing guidelines for the process of renaming and de-naming titles affiliated with Hopkins buildings, scholarships and programs, including names that may be tied to racism or inequality. Over the past few months, the committee has hosted several listening sessions to engage with Hopkins community members in the process. In an interview with The News-Letter, Committee Co-Chair and Vice Chair of the Board of Trustees Anthony Anderson (Class of 1976) detailed the group’s goal. “Our committee is not responsible for addressing individual names. Our mandate is to come up with the principles that should be applied in the reconsideration of a name,“ he said. Anderson emphasized that the committee’s focus is not to erase unfavorable parts of the University’s past but to address

The University recently unveiled its new internally-operated dining plan, which has brought opinions for both new and returning students. The transition was made to allow for more sustainable food practices, enhanced student experience and collaboration with local partners, like Gold Crust Bakery. In an email to The News-Letter, Assistant Vice President for Media Relations and News J.B. Bird explained that the University’s shift to in-house dining was in response to requests and expectations from students on food services and options provided by the University. “The goal of moving to self-operated dining was to be able to build a program that places a priority on the student experience and aligns with the values and mission of the university,” he wrote. “This long-term goal embraces our commitment to a student-centered dining experience as well as sustainability and public health goals that will drive us to become a leader in dining service for

Hopkins Dining employees held a picket line demonstration on Nov. 2 to protest the treatment of food service workers at the University. The Hopkins Dining union, represented by UNITE HERE Local 7, presented their finalized negotiations to the University on Nov. 4. Earlier this year, the University established a new dining program to take food service employees in-house. Previously all food service employees were employed by contract. Roxie Herbekian is the president of UNITE HERE Local 7. In an interview with The News-Letter, Herbekian stated that negotiations with the University regarding wages, insurance, vacation time and sick leave for food service employees are going well. According to her, the contentious issue is job security. Although food service employees have been brought in-house, the University continues to employ additional food service employees via a temporary agency, which are not covered by the union. Herbekian described the issues this poses. “People in

PILOT, the academic support program offered to students to work on problem sets in groups, will be introducing artificial intelligence (AI) technology to a number of sessions in mid-October. This development follows a number of announcements on Hopkins’s goal to find a place for AI in education. The PILOT program will offer ChatGPT as an additional resource to the students over a period of three weeks. This initiative will be an experimental one that could help the University gauge AI tools’ utility in aiding education. In an email to The News-Letter, Director of Academic Support Ariane Kelly elaborated on how the AI tools will be implemented in PILOT sessions. “The study participants will take a 30-minute quiz that is aligned with the content and weekly progress of the syllabus,” she wrote. “Students will be randomly assigned into a control arm (no use of ChatGPT), a one-round use of ChatGPT arm

Last week, the Hopkins graduate student union hosted a practice picket on both the Homewood and the East Baltimore campuses following nine months of failed contract negotiations with the University. Teachers and Researchers United (TRU) — affiliated with United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (UE) — demanded a contract that includes a closed union shop, recognition of the work done by graduate students and fair compensation and benefits. The News-Letter applauded TRU-UE’s success when they became an official union last February, with a 97% majority vote, but we are disappointed that the University’s working conditions and compensation remain poor, especially given the institution’s substantial holdings. In the University’s fiscal year 2022 financial report, Hopkins disclosed ending the year with an astounding surplus of $311 million. This value is nearly double the surplus of peer institutions like Yale. Thus, Hopkins can’t excuse its pitiful wages with a lack of funds. Furthermore,

After years of struggling with the University and barely improving working conditions, almost 3,200 doctoral students at Hopkins are finally voting to form a graduate student worker union. This is the culmination of years of organizing for a living wage, protections for international students, fair grievance procedures and so much more that graduate workers need to lead a dignified life. These concerns have continued to go unaddressed, and graduate workers are now saying that enough is enough. Unionization is our opportunity to be treated as equals by negotiating a contract that guarantees research and teaching conditions that will allow graduate student workers, and in turn, this University, to thrive. Why would we go through the trouble of forming a union? The answer is simple. We do not feel valued. Over the years, Hopkins administration has failed to prioritize its doctoral students.

Members of Hopkins leadership held a town hall discussing University finances on Nov. 16. The town hall, moderated by Professor of Epidemiology and Executive Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Stephen Gange, centered around the University’s Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) financial report. At the town hall, Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Helene Grady shared that the University ended FY21 with a surplus of $213 million, which amounts to a nearly $288 million surplus since the start of COVID-19, and a $3 billion increase in the University’s endowment. After implementing austerity measures in April 2020, University leadership estimated that Hopkins would lose $100 million in FY20 and $375 million in FY21. The town hall follows criticism by faculty and students that the University was not transparent about its finances and refused to end austerity measures despite its financial surplus.

Affiliated with United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), the University’s graduate student union Teachers and Researchers United (TRU-UE) officially won recognition through a union representation election facilitated by the National Labor Relations Board in January 2023. Founded in 2014, TRU-UE started as a small group of graduate students in response to the dean’s strategic plan. This year, over 2000 graduate students voted in favor of unionization, resulting in a 97% majority and 64% turnout rate. In an interview with The News-Letter, graduate student Peter Weck, an organizer for TRU-UE since 2017, expressed his excitement for the union to be officially recognized. “For those of us who have been around since the earlier days, the last six months have been pretty surreal — especially to go from a series of years in which the hope that we were going to win the union started to fade to then,

If you’ve ever traveled from Homewood Campus to Fells Point, you’ll know how hard it can be to get to certain parts of Baltimore without shelling out money for an Uber. The Blue Jay Shuttle only offers rides within a limited radius, making it difficult to get to neighborhoods in East, West and South Baltimore. But, there’s an alternative to calling a shuttle or an Uber — Baltimore has a public transportation system. Why don’t we use it more often? A big part of the story is the lack of reliability and routes offered by Baltimore’s buses, trains and subway system. For many residents, the lackluster public transit infrastructure doesn’t just mean limited options for places to go on a night out: It jeopardizes employment opportunities and decreases economic mobility. A 2021 report from the Bloomberg School of Public Health found that 100% of jobs in the Baltimore region can

Once again, Hopkins is tied for ninth place in the U.S. News and World Report’s “Best National Universities” category. While we are grateful to attend a University that affords us so many incredible resources, one very basic resource doesn’t live up to this standard: transportation. Our high ranking is the accomplishment of all the University’s schools; as such, they should be well-connected. How can students take advantage of all the interdisciplinary opportunities Hopkins offers if they can’t even get to the Peabody Institute just a few miles down North Charles Street? The University knows that relatively few students have their own vehicle, as the lack of student parking discourages most from making such a big purchase. Moreover, students cannot be expected to have the funds to cover expensive Lyft or Uber rides just to be able to make it to class. According to the University, it’s easy to travel between

This week, the New York Times reported that President Donald Trump had paid only $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017. The report further shows that Trump did not pay federal income taxes at all for 10 out of 15 years since 2000. In Tuesday’s presidential debate, Trump called the story fake news, claiming that he had actually paid “millions of dollars” in taxes. The report comes after years of Trump dodging the public’s desire to see his tax returns. It is not required for candidates to release their tax returns, but in modern years, it is expected. Someone who is running for president should be open and transparent with the American people. We depend on our leaders to respect the government services that they are running to protect. While the President’s tax returns are not publicly available, the University’s are. Like Trump, Hopkins is not paying as

Starting April 10, the University has offered Blue Jay Shuttle rides between Homewood Campus and the COVID-19 mass vaccination site at the M&T Bank Stadium. Rides are booked through the TransLoc app, with shuttles departing daily from the Milton S. Eisenhower Library at the top of every hour from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Return trips are every half hour from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. However, several students have described the inconvenience of the trip schedules, saying that it often left them waiting for a shuttle to pick them up from the stadium. Sophomore Cristina De Jong noted that she had to use a different form of transportation due to the untimely schedule. “The one to M&T came at the right time, but I have a class at 1:30 [p.m.] and the next shuttle comes [at] 2:30 [p.m.],” she wrote in an email with The News-Letter. “Some other students

The “Hopkins bubble” is the concept that refers to students tending to avoid venturing outside of both the University mindset and the University’s physical boundaries. The bubble has a long history and is the result of various factors. History Stuart Schrader, associate research professor of Africana Studies and associate director of the Program in Racism, Immigration and Citizenship, spoke about the history behind the bubble in an interview with The News-Letter. “The Hopkins bubble isn't just a Hopkins phenomenon. It is actually a part of a broader set of limitations, barriers and restrictions in Baltimore City,” he said. “There is deep racial segregation in the city that has existed for a long time and still persists, and the Hopkins bubble, such that it is, exists in that racial segregation.” Schrader noted how although Hopkins affiliates are in part responsible for their tendency to not venture far from campus, Baltimore has

 SGA encourages Baltimore-themed freshman seminars - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By MOLLY GAHAGEN                                                     | September 26, 2020
The Student Government Association (SGA) discussed the undergraduate academic experience and coronavirus (COVID-19) safety at its weekly meeting on Tuesday, Sept. 22. Junior Class President Nathan Mudrak introduced the Second Commission on Undergraduate Education (CUE2) Resolution. The resolution included recommendations to expand the seminars available to first-year students while not making them mandatory and to incorporate an emphasis on the Baltimore community. “There’s a pretty strong sentiment that our education about the affairs of the city, generally speaking, is lacking,” Mudrak said. “[We would be] trying to integrate that a little bit more into how we welcome freshmen to our campus.” CUE2 was formed in 2017 by University President Ronald J. Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar as part of the University’s “Ten by Twenty” plan. In February, CUE2 released a draft report of various initiatives meant to improve the undergraduate academic experience, including a first-year seminar, which would allow students

 Commission evaluates tenets of undergrad experience - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

The second Commission on Undergraduate Education (CUE2), a group of faculty, staff, alumni and current undergraduates, has been working since April to evaluate the state of undergraduate education at Hopkins. CUE2 is charged with developing a report on the values of an undergraduate experience and identifying the key qualities that should define a Hopkins education. An initial report is expected by the end of fall 2018 with a second feedback period before the final report is released. The commission is co-chaired by Krieger School of Arts and Sciences Dean Beverly Wendland and Whiting School of Engineering Dean Ed Schlesinger. University President Ronald J. Daniels and Provost Sunil Kumar convened CUE2 as a part of the “Ten by Twenty” plan. Assistant Vice Provost of Education Janet Schreck, who is a member of the commission, said that it is too early for CUE2 to identify any final recommendations. Schreck addressed the need

Even if you haven’t been keeping up with the news, you’ve undoubtedly noticed the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past few years. From ChatGPT to facial recognition technology, AI is becoming increasingly accessible to even those of us without a computer science degree. While many of us grew up using AI when playing chess against a computer, we can now generate entire essays in seconds using ChatGPT (The News-Letter does not recommend doing this). At the same time, scientists are harnessing the power of AI to accomplish great feats, such as creating self-driving cars and predicting protein structure. Despite how AI proves itself useful, it also harbors the potential to be used for far more sinister purposes. Last week, deepfake pornography of Taylor Swift circulated online, sparking public discourse on the potential dangers posed by AI. A deepfake is defined as “an image or recording that has been

 Hopkins graduate student union organizes picket protest - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

The University’s graduate student union Teachers and Researchers United (TRU-UE) hosted a picket protest in front of Homewood Campus on Tuesday, Feb. 20. Members protested for a better contract with the University, with provisions including better compensation and the establishment of a closed union shop. TRU-UE is affiliated with United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE), a nationwide trade union with over 35,000 members. Union members picketed with signs from both UE and TRU during their protest. In their press release, TRU-UE highlighted the importance of graduate student labor and threatened to prepare for further escalations if the bargaining process did not progress. Several union members were quoted in their demands for future negotiations, including Emily Hoppe, a Ph.D. worker in the School of Nursing. “We envision a different, better, inclusive, thriving vision of graduate school where we don’t have to suffer.

Last week, an article from The News-Letter’s Science & Technology section was poached by an AI-powered “journalism” website called BNNBreaking only a few hours after publication. One of our writers found the BNNBreaking page, featuring a sloppily-cropped version of the same photo and a strikingly similar article about a Hopkins research fellow. The listed “author,” Waqas Arain, has allegedly penned over 26,000 articles and published approximately 530 BNNBreaking articles on Thursday, Feb. 15 alone, each a few minutes apart. Gurbaksh Chahal, BNNBreaking’s founder, says his company “represents the apex of journalistic excellence” and that “discerning the genuine from the noise is paramount.” The gall of crooks like Chalal is astounding. Frustrated cannot begin to describe how we feel about “entrepreneurs” like Chalal getting rich by skimming off the top of student journalism. To see our content so shamelessly stolen is belittling and disrespectful. Though BNNBreaking took down the offending article

Saikat Dan is a research fellow affiliated with the Computational Mechanics Research Laboratory (CMRL) and is advised by Somnath Ghosh in the Civil Engineering Department. As a PhD student this past fall, he taught a HEART course titled Computer Simulations: How Real are They? in which he gave a high-level overview of the field as well as applications of his research. Composites are materials with distinct phases such as particle, fiber and matrix and are pivotal in various industries, but they are susceptible to damage under certain environmental conditions. Dan's research aims to simulate and understand these damage mechanisms, providing invaluable insights into why such failures occur. "There are two primary steps in my research. The first part of the task involves simulating the way a material fails when it is exposed to some sort of environmental condition,” Dan said in an interview with The News-Letter. “The second part of

The semester is beginning to pick up and your schedule is already packed with PILOT sessions, club meetings and office hours. Although you may enjoy the classes you’re taking and the research you’re doing, it can be difficult to make time for activities that are purely for leisure. For those who made New Year’s resolutions focused on hobbies, you may feel like you are losing your momentum — approximately 80% of people who made resolutions do not continue them into February. While being a college student has always been time consuming, for many of us, scrolling social media has filled the hours that may have otherwise been occupied by hobbies. Watching TikTok and scanning Instagram posts may feel like a simple alternative to dedicating time to another task, but data suggests that Gen Z is not happy with how they fill their days; in one survey, 72% of Gen Z

Keeping to a tight student budget does not have to mean passing the weekend by in a void of boredom. Thanks to the wealth of free activities offered by Hopkins and the city of Baltimore, it is possible to have a meaningful day without spending a dime — it just requires some creativity. This suggested itinerary outlines a few of those opportunities to inspire your next “no-spend Saturday.” Start your morning with a trip to the 32nd Street Farmers Market, which runs every Saturday from 7 a.m. to 12 p.m. in the neighboring Waverly. The walk from Barnes & Noble to the market takes only 10 minutes and brings you to a lively collection of local vendors selling food, drink, jewelry, books and more. If you’re lucky, you might find some free samples, and there’s almost always live music for patrons to enjoy too. The products on sale here tend

 George Peabody Library: Past and present - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

The Peabody Institute was founded by George Peabody as a cultural institution for the citizens of Baltimore in 1857. Today, the George Peabody Library houses Special Collections, hosts private and public events and ensures that its materials are accessible through public engagement programming and the digitization of collections. Originally from Massachusetts, George Peabody’s business career started in Baltimore, where he shipped goods between Europe and the United States. By 1837, he moved to England and was making the majority of his wealth as a banker. In recognition of where he got his start, he endowed the City of Baltimore with $300,000 in 1857, which amounts to approximately $10.3 million today, to establish the Peabody Institute. In his founding letter, Peabody specified that the institute’s purpose is to provide an art gallery, a lecture series, a music conservatory and a free public library. “I have determined, without further delay, to establish

 Here’s some debt with your degree: College is too damn expensive - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

As Hopkins students, we know all too well how expensive college can be, from tuition to dining plans and everything in between. However, higher education has not always been so costly. In the last 40 years, the average cost of college tuition has increased by 168%, while wages only increased by 19%. The lack of comparable increases in wages has made paying tuition challenging, leading millions of students to take on loans to afford their education. More than half of all students graduating from college have student loans, and the average federal student loan debt is estimated to be a whopping $28,950. Hopkins is not insulated from the trend of rising college tuition and student debt. In the past decade, the cost of attendance at Hopkins, including tuition and living costs, has increased 10% more than the average increase at other U.S. colleges.

The Student Government Association (SGA) held its weekly meeting this Tuesday, Jan. 30. Chief Justice Luc Mazzanobile and Chair of the Committee on Student Elections Nubaira Milki presented the Spring elections timeline that will occur between late February and mid-March. Mazzanobile also presented on the 2024 student nominations for Committee on Student Elections Council after which a closed voting began. President Stone Meng, KSAS Senator Tim Huang and Secretary Amy Li presented on the Academic Resources Initiative. The initiative has successfully made iClickers free for all undergraduate students starting in Spring 2024. There were discussions on the possibility of working with Macmillan Learning representatives to obtain other Macmillan Learning products, including Chem21Labs and Achieve platforms. Potential other initiatives include free printing and more accessible supply closets for students.

If you haven’t noticed yet from the many posters around campus or the flurry of social media activity, it is officially time to elect our student government representatives for the next year. The Student Government Association (SGA) elections are set for March 11 and 12, and positions range from class senators to the Executive Board. In contrast to last year’s election, all candidates running for the Executive Board have prior SGA experience. We are optimistic that this institutional knowledge of how SGA functions will enable effective governance and recognition of the limitations of SGA. Yet, we’re disappointed to see a relative lack of interest in the Executive Board positions. While 10 students competed for five positions in last year’s elections, this year, there are only seven candidates. Further, three of the elections are uncontested. SGA voter turnout has historically been low, and we as students feel less inclined to vote

Once again, all but one position of the Student Government Association (SGA) Executive Board elections are uncontested. In past years, we’ve noted that those appointed in uncontested elections often lack accountability and encouragement to undertake new initiatives. Some of last year’s uncontested candidates are running in this year’s elections. One reason for the lack of competition among these positions is because the Committee on Student Elections (CSE) schedules SGA Class Council and Executive Board elections concurrently. This means that those who do not win positions on the Executive Board will not be able to run for other positions in next year’s SGA. As noted previously by the Editorial Board, this hinders experienced and committed members from running for higher positions and remaining involved in initiating change on campus. Not only are the elections largely uncontested, but voter turnout has been decreasing every year. Last year, only 12% of students participated

In an attempt to increase voter turnout and streamline the voting process, the student body will vote for candidates on the Student Government Association’s (SGA) class councils and executive boards at the same time this year. While we hope that students take this opportunity to get more involved in the election process, we recognize a major flaw in the Committee for Student Elections (CSE)’s decision to reschedule elections: There will be at least four students this year who do not get elected to an executive board position and will not have the opportunity to be involved in their SGA class council. Moreover, while this year’s executive board election is more competitive than it has been in recent years, none of the class council president positions are contested, and no one is running for senior class senator. There will be at least eight vacancies after this election ends. We suspect that

The Student Government Association (SGA) debated different topics it will push for during its upcoming annual dinner with University President Ronald J. Daniels at its weekly meeting on Tuesday. Members also voted on four bills, including the introduction of a Latinx & Hispanic Caucus. At the dinner, SGA members will present their ideas on topics they believe are of high importance to the student body. Some topics included student organization funding, civic engagement, transportation, mental health and changes to the academic calendar. Students agreed that their dinner with Daniels should include a discussion about student organizations on campus. Junior Class President Isaac Lucas explained that they hoped their conversation could help construct a better system to distribute funds. “We are trying to work with President Daniels about how to get a more straightforward organizations system and be more upfront about organizations, about where their money is coming from and where

Student Government Association (SGA) members voted unanimously to create a formal black student caucus at their weekly meeting on Tuesday. Senior Class Senator Madi Uraih, who introduced the bill, stressed the need for SGA to represent the concerns of black undergraduates on campus. “It’s particularly salient because we only have two members on this body who identify as black or African American, while the school’s population of black students is 11 percent and rising,” she said. “I also thought this was particularly important after I saw that University of Maryland, College Park, just instituted a black caucus.” Uraih further noted that instituting a black caucus is important given the University’s current bid to create its own private police force. Some, including members of the Black Student Union (BSU), have criticized this proposed police force because of the possibility of racial profiling. Uraih emphasized the importance of examining how SGA bills

In an email to the student body on Friday, the University announced that it would be implementing changes to the academic calendar in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 and seeking student input on proposed finals schedules. University Registrar and Assistant Vice Provost Tom Black explained in an email to The News-Letter that the new academic calendar is meant to provide consistency across University divisions. “The new academic calendar was started as the initial step of the Student Services Excellence Initiative (SSEI) for Registration, since there were 24 different calendars throughout all JHU divisions. Each divisional Registrar worked closely with University Administration and SSEI staff to coordinate their calendars for the next 10 academic years,” Black wrote. According to the initial email, the University seeks to align the undergraduate calendar with the activities of other schools under the University umbrella so that students can pursue joint degrees across the various academic

The Student Government Association (SGA) discussed potential changes to grading amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak at their meeting on Tuesday, March 24. Open to the student body, the meeting was held on Zoom, an online conference call platform. Following the University’s announcement that remote classes will continue through the end of the semester, several petitions were formed to implement changes to the University’s grading policy. The three grading options that were discussed during the SGA meeting were universal A/A-, universal satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) and opt-in satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U). Senior Class Senator Chase McAdams and Sophomore Class President Nathan Mudrak met with the Homewood Academic Council on Wednesday afternoon alongside other student and faculty representatives from the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and Whiting School of Engineering to finalize a decision.

The Committee on Student Elections (CSE) announced the results of the Student Government Association (SGA) executive board elections on Friday, March 13. Three out of four members of the Focus Forward ticket and one independent candidate won seats, beating out the other candidates. The 2020-21 SGA executive board will include junior Sam Mollin as executive president, sophomore Mehak Ali as executive vice president, freshman Breanna Soldatelli as executive secretary and junior Addy Perlman as executive treasurer. Mollin ran as an independent candidate. Ali, Soldatelli, Perlman and sophomore Pritika Parmar comprised the Focus Forward ticket, while sophomore Eric Armstrong and freshmen Greta Maras and Daniel Weber comprised the Taking Flight ticket. Three of the executive board positions were contested, with three candidates running for executive president, two candidates running for executive secretary and executive treasurer and Ali running uncontested for executive vice president.

There is not universal easy access to the vote. There are too many hoops and hurdles to jump through. Government websites and bureaucracy are a pain to navigate with confusing language and endless rabbit holes. Casting a ballot on Election Day is a burden, with busy schedules and long waiting times. And many elected officials are trying to make it even harder now, introducing 165 bills seeking to restrict voting rights across the country. Now add the challenge of being a new voter. In 2020, national voter turnout under the age of 29 was between 52-55% compared to 66.7% among all eligible voters. In 2018, only 54% of Marylanders aged 18-24 were registered to vote, compared to 66% of all Marylanders over the age of 18. Although these are just the statistics regarding young people, we have a long way to go in making the vote accessible to many groups,

There’s a lot of talk about low turnout among young voters, especially in the wake of Super Tuesday. Bernie Sanders’ campaign counted on a wave of new young voters heading to the polls and carrying him to victory — a wave that failed to appear, even though Sanders did overwhelmingly win among young voters. So why couldn’t Sanders get students to the polls? The fact is that an “exciting” candidate is still not enough to dramatically increase the rate at which young people vote, because political apathy isn’t the source of the problem. The problem is that college students face unique hurdles in registering to vote. The Maryland legislature recently had the opportunity to pass the Student Voter Empowerment Act, which would have increased young voter participation and fostered civic engagement. This bill would have required institutions to create and implement a plan to teach students about voter registration. It

The Student Voter Empowerment Act, a bill introduced in the Maryland State Senate designed to encourage university students to register and turn-out to vote, failed to pass out of committee on Feb. 28. The Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee deadlocked 5-5 on the vote to advance the bill to the full Senate. The bill aimed to increase student voter participation in the state by requiring that universities create plans to encourage their students to register to vote. A number of Hopkins students have been involved with the bill through the Maryland Public Interest Research Group (PIRG). Maryland PIRG is a student activist nonprofit organization that seeks to advocate for consumers and the public interest. Rishi Shah, a Hopkins alum who now works as a democracy fellow at Maryland PIRG, explained that he originally got involved with PIRG because he believed in the importance of making the government more responsive

 Our endorsements for the (largely uncontested) 2021-22 SGA Executive Board - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By THE EDITORIAL BOARD                                                     | March 25, 2021
Only one candidate in this year’s Student Government Association’s (SGA) Executive Board elections is running opposed. We suspect that this is because, for the second year, elections for the SGA class councils and executive board are being held at the same time in an effort to increase voter turnout and streamline the voting process. As the Editorial Board noted in its endorsements a year ago, “a major flaw in the Committee for Student Elections’ (CSE) decision to reschedule elections” is that students who do not get elected to an executive board position “will not have the opportunity to be involved in their SGA class council.” It is unfortunate that qualified representatives did not run because they were scared to lose. Uncontested elections promote the recurrent issue of student apathy toward SGA, as well as less effective governance. It is a shame that students have few candidates to choose from to

 SGA introduces idea for a Community Council - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By RUDY MALCOM                                                     | October 18, 2018
The Student Government Association (SGA) discussed the idea of a JHU Community Council (JCC) at their weekly meeting on Tuesday, Oct. 16. The JCC was introduced as part of SGA’s Power and Authorities Initiative to expand its influence over University decisions. Executive Vice President AJ Tsang said that SGA hopes to create meaningful and tangible change through the JCC. Tsang elaborated that the JCC would include equal numbers of staff, faculty, student, alumni and potentially Baltimore community leaders. He explained that SGA came up with the idea for the JCC while looking at similar plans at peer universities. “Princeton University, in 1969, in the midst of the civil rights movement, executed this committee... showing America as a whole what democratic and shared governance would look like,“ Tsang said. “The president established their committee to be a permanent representative body of constituencies of the University.” He added that although the JCC

To say that the University has a history of poor communication is an understatement. This has been particularly evident over the course of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. For example, amid a nationwide reckoning with structural racism, Hopkins has yet to take any meaningful action to address its contributions to these issues. While we were signing leases and booking flights, Hopkins failed to update us on its plans for the fall semester. And now that we have inevitably returned to Baltimore, Hopkins has failed to offer us adequate support. Where administrators have struggled, the Student Government Association (SGA) has excelled in recent months. When the University was unclear about move-out protocols last spring, SGA explained the details of the process. After George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police, SGA emailed the student body two weeks before the University issued its performative statement of solidarity. It was SGA, not the

This Tuesday, Oct. 1, the Student Government Association (SGA) met for the first time in three weeks. This marked only the third meeting of the academic year. The previous two meetings, scheduled for Sept. 17 and 24, were cancelled. When asked why the usual meetings had been suspended, Executive Vice President Dean Chien wrote in an email to The News-Letter: “We are a policy driven body and that means that if there is a bill or resolution on the floor or some guest presentation, we will meet, if not then there’s really no need to meet.” He added, “That being said, we are not going to be in the business of not meeting.” We are glad that SGA plans on having regular sessions. That being said, we find it hard to believe that they had nothing to discuss these past few weeks. How is it that our representatives have no

Elections for next year’s Student Government Association (SGA) executive board will open this Friday, April 7. The two tickets running for office are “New Horizons” and “HopForward.” New Horizons consists of sophomore Noh Mebrahtu running for executive president, sophomore AJ Tsang for executive vice president, freshman Rushabh Doshi for executive secretary and sophomore Mi Tu for executive treasurer. The New Horizons’ platform identifies six main pillars: mental health, diversity and inclusion, environmental advocacy, civic engagement, SGA transparency and school spirit. The HopForward ticket includes junior Anna Du running for executive president, freshman Alex Walinskas for executive vice president, junior Lucas Rosen for executive secretary and sophomore Kush Mansuria for executive treasurer. Their HopForward platform focuses on innovation, inclusion, and health and well-being. HopFoward wants to work with student groups focused on entrepreneurship and reform the Student Activities Commission (SAC) bylaws. Du explained their plan to post an idea board on

To increase student voter turnout, Hopkins recently partnered with TurboVote, an online voting registration service. Over 300 universities have partnered with TurboVote, which was created by nonprofit and nonpartisan group Democracy Works. Its co-founders wanted to create a way for people to be aware of election dates and registration deadlines, especially for local and special elections. TurboVote’s services include walking students through the voter registration process, notifying students via text or email about upcoming elections in the district where they are registered, and sending absentee ballot request forms with a pre-stamped and pre-addressed envelope. TurboVote also has a free 24-hour hotline to answer any questions students may have about the voting process. The process to register takes three to five minutes and is free of charge for anyone affiliated with the University. Sophomore Class President Anthony Boutros, head of the Student Government Association (SGA)’s Civic Engagement Committee, helped implement TurboVote

Next week, the Student Government Association (SGA) will hold an impeachment trial against Executive President Noh Mebrahtu behind closed doors. SGA members introduced articles of impeachment at their latest weekly meeting, but not before telling one of our reporters to leave the room. That same day, SGA sent an email advertising a Students Against Private Police rally with the subject line “ICE Protest Tomorrow!” And last semester, it had to pass a bill to stop members from using social media, texting, web surfing and shopping during meetings. We believe that there are SGA members who genuinely care about our interests and are deeply committed to advocating for the student body. Yet SGA’s recent acts make us question whether our representatives are able to tackle increasingly urgent issues on campus, especially if they are not informed, transparent or focused. In the past, SGA members have succeeded in improving the Hopkins experience

Climate activists around the world took part in a mass strike on Friday. Refuel Our Future, an environmental activist group on campus, led about 20 Hopkins students to the climate strike in D.C. Speakers protested government inaction and demanded justice for communities of color impacted by pollution, leading thousands of demonstrators from John Marshall Park to the west lawn of the United States Capitol. The News-Letter spoke with students who attended the rally and other Hopkins affiliates about their efforts to promote sustainability. D.C. Climate Strike Freshman Juneau Wang, attended the strike. Although he expressed his enthusiasm for climate activism, he also criticized what he characterized as the University’s current environmental inaction. “Many of the people in power are not doing anything to roll back the damage,” he said. “All the little green measures that Hopkins takes don’t mean anything when they’re pumping huge sums of money into the coffers

When the University announced its intention to create a private police force in March 2018, it failed to consult Hopkins affiliates and community members. After the announcement met with widespread backlash and Maryland legislators postponed voting on the bill, administrators promised to do a better job of consulting students and Baltimore residents. After months of protests against the private police force bill — which culminated in a month-long sit-in and the arrest of four students and three community members — the bill passed in the Maryland General Assembly this past spring. As we’ve been grappling with the reality of a private police force, we’ve hoped that the University would do a better job of taking the concerns of students and community members into account. So far, it’s not off to a promising start. Since May, the University has been searching for a replacement for Melissa Hyatt, who became vice president

Dunkin’ Donuts began marketing its first vegan breakfast sandwich to consumers in the New York City area on July 24, with plans to expand the offering nationally in the future. Dunkin’s decision to launch a spinoff of their popular traditional Sausage, Egg & Cheese options began with an online petition launched by Lana Weidgenant, a junior at Hopkins majoring in Public Health Studies. Weidgenant initiated a petition on the social change website Change.org a little more than a month earlier. The petition called on Dunkin’ to follow in the footsteps of Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons by introducing Beyond Meat sausage options to their breakfast sandwich line. Beyond Meat produces plant-based burgers that attempt to replicate the taste and appearance of real meat. In an interview with The News-Letter, Weidgenant commented on her efforts to make vegan food options more accessible. Weidgenant chose to go vegan upon arriving

The University hired Julian Goresko as its new director of sustainability at the end of last year with the intent of making Hopkins more eco-friendly. The Office of Sustainability is responsible for optimizing all nine divisions of the University’s food, water and energy consumption, along with its infrastructure, transportation and waste management. Last April, University President Ronald J. Daniels announced the creation of a new University-wide Sustainability Leadership Council (SLC) in an email to the University student body. The Council will bring together students, staff and faculty from all nine divisions to advise Provost Sunil Kumar on matters of sustainability. In an email to The News-Letter, Goresko stated that he plans to begin work on the SLC immediately. “This advisory council is an exciting step forward to uniting our campus partners in a robust vision for addressing sustainability through the lens of academics, research, operations and engagement,” Goresko wrote.

Last March, as the University shut down due to coronavirus (COVID-19), many students left campus housing with most of their belongings still in their dorms. With intent to temporarily house healthcare workers responding to the pandemic, the University announced that it hired outside “professional movers” to pack student belongings in select dorms. The move-out process began in May and students were given the option to either schedule an appointment to retrieve their belongings from their dorms or to have movers pack up their rooms. Students returning to Baltimore are asked to schedule an appointment to retrieve their belongings from a storage facility at the Bayview Campus in East Baltimore In interviews with The News-Letter, students reported that the University failed to responsibly pack, store and return their belongings. Junior Alice Xie told The News-Letter that four hours before her scheduled pick-up appointment, the University informed her that they were unable

For the residential students who had to vacate their dorms from March 13-15 due to coronavirus (COVID-19), moving out was a stressful experience. Days before, when announcing the suspension of in-person classes, the University had notified students that they had the option to stay. Then some students no longer had a place to stay. Many were forced to leave their belongings. On March 20, students received a follow-up email notifying them that external movers would be packing and storing their belongings. However, on March 28, Vice Provost for Student Affairs Alanna Shanahan informed residential students that movers would only pack some rooms. Chief of Staff to the Vice Provost for Student Affairs Lee Hawthorne explained in an email to The News-Letter that administrators decided to pack rooms that served as appropriate temporary housing for health-care workers. Administrators changed their decision due to the rapidly changing nature of the pandemic. “As

Students will be allowed to return to residence halls to begin the move-out process beginning today, May 18. Director Sarah Mansfield of Housing Operations had emailed residential students on May 12 explaining that students may schedule time slots via the housing portal. The email emphasized that students are not required to return to campus. The University will coordinate with students who do not retrieve their belongings to hire professional movers to pack and store them. For students who have not chosen a time slot by June 1, the University will arrange to have their belongings stored. Rising sophomore Amara Gammon, currently living with her family in Waldorf, Md., stated in an email to The News-Letter that she plans to return to campus for her belongings.

The Student Government Association (SGA) held its weekly meeting on March 8 to discuss the transition to the University’s new dining contract, the transferal of more clubs under SGA oversight and representative reports. Dining service transition The University will be transitioning from Bon Appétit to a self-operated dining service after this year. Minor construction for this transition will begin during the summer of 2022. Assistant Vice Provost of Dining Matt Moss spoke about how the new service will place an emphasis on student input and participation in their dining experiences. He especially emphasized efforts to provide more diverse options, including culturally authentic foods. Moss elaborated on the ways the new service will expand and increase student engagement. He mentioned that the University had identified a separation between students and dining staff faculty.

Hopkins plans to shift to a self-operated dining model for the Homewood and Peabody campuses and take over operation and oversight of the new dining programs. The transition will happen during the summer of 2022 when the contract with the Bon Appétit Management Company, signed in 2013, will end. Under the new model, the University plans to renovate its dining facilities, standardize meal plans across the two campuses and incorporate campus cafes into dining plans. Two new dining areas will also be constructed in the renovated Rec Center and the to-be constructed Stavros Niarchos Foundation Agora Institute building. In an email to The News-Letter, Ian Magowan, senior manager of dining programs, explained that the University aims to develop closer relationships with its staff and local partners through the new model. “Self-operating the dining program will allow for relationships with vendors, producers and operators to be held directly by the University

The Food Service Selection Committee and Hopkins Dining announced that Bon Appetit Management Company is to replace Aramark as the new dining provider on the Homewood Campus. Aramark’s seven-year contract with Hopkins expires at the end of the semester, and Bon Appetit will begin operating Homewood dining venues during the summer term. Bon Appetit was selected after substantial research and a thorough review of numerous company proposals. “Though on-campus dining has improved tremendously over the past couple of years, I feel like the general consensus has been that students are still a bit disappointed,” Alex Schupper, Executive Vice President of SGA, said. “Obviously, we didn’t want to settle for something our community isn’t happy with.” Bon Appétit is an onsite restaurant company that provides food services to corporations, such as Google and Starbucks, as well as colleges and universities.

The Hopkins community gathered on Friday in support of the Real Food Challenge and the signing of the Real Food Campus Commitment by President Ronald J. Daniels. The contract commits the University to a new sustainable food purchasing policy, notably promising to boost “real food” on campus by 35 percent by 2020. The signing was followed by the fourth annual 100 Mile Meal, in which attendees enjoyed a sit-down meal with the president and members of Real Food Hopkins. Real Food Hopkins is the student-run chapter of the national organization the Real Food Challenge, a campaign aiming to leverage the power of youths across the country to create a healthier, more sustainable and economically viable food system. The primary goal of the challenge is to shift $1 billion worth of University food budgets towards local and community-based produce that is ecologically grown and abides to the conditions of fair trade.

Students from the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions attended the Real Food Baltimore Regional Action Training and Strategy Retreat, hosted by Real Food Hopkins, at Charles Commons from Feb. 11-14. The weekend’s events centered around protesting the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement, as well as planning new initiatives and strategies to promote “real” food on college campuses. Real Food Hopkins is Hopkins’ chapter of the Real Food Challenge (RFC), a national, student-led food movement whose goal is to shift $1 billion of food budgets towards purchasing locally grown, sustainable, fair trade and ecologically sound food. Approximately forty students from schools such as The University of Vermont, Princeton University, Clarke University and University of Maryland — Baltimore County (UMBC), among others, travelled to Hopkins to participate in the action training and strategy retreat.

Two weeks ago, the Stavros Niarchos Foundation (SNF) Agora Institute unveiled plans for the construction of a building to house the Institute. The planned construction start date is fall 2020, with estimated completion by summer 2022. The SNF Agora Institute, which was established with a $150 million gift last year that included funding for a new building, is intended to serve as an academic and public forum to promote civic engagement. The building will be constructed on Wyman Park Drive, where a parking lot is currently located. The SNF Agora Institute has instated a Student Advisory Board in order to encourage student involvement in the establishment of the building. The Board held its first meeting this Tuesday. Students are skeptical about the building’s ability to be an inclusive environment, although Kendall Free, a member of the Board, expressed hope that the SNF Agora Institute may be able to successfully involve

This March, Real Food Hopkins, a student organization promoting food justice and sustainability, launched the Pour Out Pepsi campaign. According to Real Food Co-President Katie Smith, PepsiCo has a history of violating human rights, labor laws and sustainability regulations. The group aimed to convince Hopkins Dining to end its exclusivity contract with PepsiCo, which requires that 80 percent of all beverages sold on campus — not just soft drinks — are manufactured by PepsiCo. Real Food met with Dining earlier this month to discuss the state of the contract, which was up for renewal in June. Senior Manager of Dining Programs Ian Magowan explained in an email to The News-Letter that Dining has not yet signed a new contract and is conducting an internal review of the terms and conditions set by PepsiCo.

Real Food Hopkins, a student organization promoting food justice and sustainability, launched the Pour Out Pepsi campaign on March 11.

The group aims to convince Hopkins Dining to end the exclusivity contract with PepsiCo. This contract requires that 80 percent of all beverages sold on campus — not just soft drinks — are manufactured by PepsiCo. Smith referred to a report from April 2017, which found that PepsiCo knowingly imports palm oil from ecologically destructive plantations in Indonesia. Underpaid children, as young as 13, harvest oil in these plantations. In May 2016, the International Union of Food workers accused PepsiCo of repeatedly blocking West Bengali factory workers from forming a trade union.

By THE EDITORIAL BOARD                                                     | March 13, 2023
With another spring semester, the next Student Government Association (SGA) Executive Board election is upon us. This year, most positions are not uncontested, which is a welcome improvement from years prior. We hope that the increased number of candidates marks the start of SGA building itself back up. Here at The News-Letter, we’ve made our disappointment in SGA clear. The organization has historically failed to maintain the transparency and open communication with the student body that many representatives campaign on. When newly-elected candidates begin their terms, we hope they prioritize addressing these issues. Several of the Executive Board candidates this year don’t have SGA experience, which presents both pros and cons. Newcomers may have a unique perspective on what students care about and how SGA can improve as an organization. However, we ultimately believe that SGA representatives should understand the institution they’re operating within. Upon interviewing SGA Executive Board candidates,

 SGA stresses the need for more PILOT funding - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By XINYUE GU                                                     | March 26, 2021
The Student Government Association (SGA) discussed a resolution to provide more funding to the PILOT program during its weekly meeting on Tuesday, March 23. PILOT sessions are weekly, student-led meetings in which members of a class meet with a student who has previously done well in the class to go over problem sets. Senior Class Senator Anish Nayak and Freshman Class Senator Jenny Chen introduced the PILOT funding resolution, which will go into effect in the fall semester. Chen explained that many freshmen have expressed the need for more academic support from PILOT. According to Chen, Ariane Kelly, the director of academic support, told her that PILOT lacks the funding to have additional courses. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Chen said, there has been a significant rise in the number of students enrolled in PILOT. Right now, around 1,600 students are enrolled for various classes. “For most students, the

Once again, all but one position of the Student Government Association (SGA) Executive Board elections are uncontested. In past years, we’ve noted that those appointed in uncontested elections often lack accountability and encouragement to undertake new initiatives. Some of last year’s uncontested candidates are running in this year’s elections. One reason for the lack of competition among these positions is because the Committee on Student Elections (CSE) schedules SGA Class Council and Executive Board elections concurrently. This means that those who do not win positions on the Executive Board will not be able to run for other positions in next year’s SGA. As noted previously by the Editorial Board, this hinders experienced and committed members from running for higher positions and remaining involved in initiating change on campus. Not only are the elections largely uncontested, but voter turnout has been decreasing every year. Last year, only 12% of students participated

According to its constitution, the Student Government Association (SGA) was founded upon “the importance of strengthening student unity, representing student interests and providing a forum for the exchange of ideas.” Unfortunately, we’re not sure these lofty ideals are being met. We notice SGA making efforts to plan and improve events now that we’re fully back on campus, such as the Instagram Raffle Bill and the Well-Being Fair Funding Bill. But there should be a balance between organizing leisure-based activities and addressing important issues on campus. We are disappointed that SGA has yet to comment on the University’s resumed implementation of the Johns Hopkins Police Department (JHPD), despite recent town halls and protests attended by students. We know SGA is capable of addressing the contentious issue. In 2019, SGA passed a resolution opposing the University’s bill to create the JHPD, and in 2020, it signed a petition calling for a permanent

Student Government Association (SGA) members passed a resolution in opposition of the University’s bill to create a private police force during their weekly meeting on Tuesday. In doing so, they officially endorsed the Garland sit-in spearheaded by Students Against Private Police (SAPP) and the Hopkins Coalition Against ICE (U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement). The resolution, introduced by Freshmen Class Senator Alexander Forlenza, outlined common concerns about a private police force students have brought forward over the past year, including the potential racial profiling of students of color. Additionally, the resolution noted that 74.4 percent of respondents voted against the creation of a private police force in SGA’s referendum. Furthermore, Forlenza noted that student organizations such as SAPP, the Black Student Union (BSU) and the African Students Association (ASA) have voiced opposition against the private police initiative. Freshman Class Senator Eric Armstrong expressed concerns that the student body data was skewed

The Student Government Association (SGA) held its weekly meeting on Sept. 20 to discuss collaboration between SGA and the Peabody General Assembly (PGA), student access to alumni connections and career opportunities, the Instagram Raffle Bill and the Well-being Fair Funding Bill. Peabody General Assembly Collaboration PGA Cross Campus Liaison Jacquelyn Slade presented initiatives to improve dining options and nutrition, provide reliable transportation across campuses and connect Hopkins and Peabody Institute student body events. SGA has submitted a joint dining report and met with dining administrators in the hopes of fostering a student-staff relationship, broadening surveys of students and guaranteeing access to food across campuses. Slade expressed a desire to “connect the Homewood and Peabody dining committees with SGA and PGA, including the [Committee on Student Services]” to increase the chances of improved meals.

The Student Government Association (SGA) held its weekly general body meeting (GBM) on Nov. 29 to discuss the judiciary nominations, the Beta X SGA: Reindeer Games Bill, the SGA Communications and Marketing Committee (CMC) Funding Bill and the SGA x Mindfulness Event Funding Bill. Judiciary Nominations Four of the five student justices graduated last spring, and no nominees have been presented in the past six months. Sophomore President Ryan Chou motioned an amendment to the agenda to discuss judiciary nomination in a moderated caucus. The motion was passed unanimously. Chou independently used social media over the Thanksgiving break to advertise the positions and interviewed seven applicants. Senior Class President JiWon Woo cited ambiguity in the layout methods of the judiciary nomination bylaws while providing additional context to Chou’s action. An initial application was sent out to Hopkins in early September, receiving responses from three applicants by Oct. 3. The executive

Beta X SGA Reindeer Games Bill Sophomore Class Senator Dalhart Dobbs introduced the Beta X SGA Reindeer Games Bill. The bill endorses a philanthropy event with the Beta Theta Pi fraternity that would feature outdoor game tournaments, with all proceeds going to Black Women Build Baltimore. The bill requests $400 of funding to be spent on prizes. Sophomore Class Senator Jackson Morris inquired about how much Beta Theta Pi will contribute to the event. Dobbs responded that Beta will be providing all the needed equipment. The bill was tabled to be read again at the next GBM.

Candidates for the 2023–24 Student Government Association (SGA) Executive Board elections include a single ticket and five independent candidates. The SGA Executive Board debate will be held on March 9, and voting will be open from March 14 to 15. Four candidates are running for student body president: freshman Nver Saghatelyan, freshman James Yoon, junior Clement Adedeji and current sophomore Class President Ryan Chou. There are two candidates running for the chair of programming, a new position established this year: junior Class Senator Shalala Leny and freshman Class Senator Alisa Fedotova. Current sophomore Class Senator Jackson Morris and current freshman Class Senator Amy Li are running for the positions of vice president and secretary, respectively. Two candidates are running for treasurer: current junior Class Senator Jenny Chen and freshman Class Senator Sean Li.

 Inaugural JHU Major Fair introduces students to departments and faculty - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

The inaugural JHU Major Fair took place on Friday Feb. 16 and was hosted by the Student Government Association (SGA) to introduce Hopkins students to various departments and new opportunities. Roughly 300 people attended the fair over the course of the afternoon, and over 40 different majors and minors were represented at the event. Majors spanned departments in both the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences (KSAS) and the Whiting School of Engineering (WSE), and ranged from Film and Media Studies to Mechanical Engineering. KSAS Senator Tim Huang, who created the event, elaborated on his hopes for the Major Fair in an email to The News-Letter. “I hope that students go out of their comfort zones and truly explore new opportunities that are available to them,” he wrote. “Our school has the option to switch majors at any time, and I believe all students should truly pursue what interests them.”

If you spent your break checking Canvas from the beaches of Cancún or frantically writing papers from airport terminals, you are not the only one. Contrary to what the name might suggest, spring break doesn’t always feel like a break. Our academic responsibilities seldom pause for our vacations with friends or trips back home. Students at Hopkins deserve the opportunity to take a real break. Yet, when we are concerned about looming paper deadlines and midterm exams set for the first week back, we aren’t able to relax to the fullest. Though the deans of the Whiting School of Engineering have issued a request for faculty to "consider" refraining from burdening students with assignments during spring break, the effectiveness of this appeal is questionable. The University should be doing more — beyond vague and flimsy language — to ensure that students get a break. The failure to implement enforceable measures

Hopkins undergraduates are notoriously studious, but even the loftiest intellectuals must close their books sometimes. Most students strike a delicate balance of work and downtime, living in anticipation of school holidays like Thanksgiving and spring break when they can finally relax. But vacations aren’t always the stress-free breaks that they should be, especially when schoolwork piles up. At Hopkins there are currently no administrative restrictions regarding the assignment of schoolwork over breaks. Other schools have recognized this problem, and at Cornell the administration has proposed to ban assignments over breaks in an effort to limit the stress placed on their students. Hopkins does not have a ban like this, but a number of students would like to see it implemented. Sophomore Meghan Kellett, a biology major, said that she recognizes the importance of protecting student’s mental health. “We shouldn’t have anything due right after break. People need downtime to recoup,”

The Student Government Association (SGA) held its weekly General Body Meeting (GBM) on Oct. 4 to discuss a resolution calling for a homework-free fall break and the Presidential Appointment Amendment. Fall Break Resolution Junior Class Senator Shalala Leny and Freshman Class Senator Amy Li introduced the Fall Break Resolution, which requests professors limit the amount of work they assign students before and after fall break. Li added that SGA attempted a similar resolution last year, but it did not work out because of its late proposal. Li stated that “this is why we’re proposing [the Fall Break Resolution] relatively early.” The resolution emphasizes the importance of school-life balance for students’ health and academic performance. It also requests that a survey allowing students to anonymously report professors who assign homework over the break be implemented. The resolution passed unanimously.

If you’ve ever walked to Homewood Apartments, you have likely noticed the houses on N. Charles Street that are marked by the classic navy Hopkins signage. You may have looked at them and wondered, “Why does Hopkins own this? What’s in there? How can I get in?” At Hopkins, we’re familiar with the uses of campus landmarks, even if we don’t frequent the buildings ourselves. Students watch dance shows in Shriver Hall, learn French in Gilman Hall and experiment with circuits in the Bloomberg Center for Physics and Astronomy. It seems pretty straightforward. But the University’s real estate holdings extend far beyond the gates of Homewood Campus, and the functions of many Hopkins-owned buildings remain largely unknown to the student body. You might think that you’ve left Hopkins territory by walking a few blocks away from campus, but as the navy signage follows you, one thing is clear: The Hopkins

Arguably known as the central landmark of the Homewood campus, Gilman Hall is often regarded as the first major academic building on Homewood campus. Construction commenced on Gilman Hall in 1913, and the $509,063 project — equivalent to $10 –11 million dollars in 2023 — was completed in 1915. Offices moved in the summer of that year. Designed by Douglas Thomas, Gilman Hall is named in memory of the first president of the University, Daniel Coit Gilman, who became president in 1876. Gilman shaped the University based on the model of German research institutions and helped define Hopkins as one of the first and most robust research universities. Gilman Hall originally housed a library, seminar rooms and department offices. Prior to Milton S. Eisenhower Library’s construction in 1964, Gilman Hall also served as the main library on campus. After 1964, books were moved out of Gilman, and faculty used the

This past Alumni Weekend, members of the first full class of female undergraduates were welcomed back to Hopkins to commemorate 50 years since their graduation. Since then, we’ve come a long way on making progress toward gender equity in academics, athletics and campus culture. As of fall 2022, 55% of Hopkins undergraduates were women, a far cry from the measly 11% of female undergraduates in 1971. Beyond metrics, Hopkins has devoted its resources to inclusivity both inside and outside the classroom. The University recently announced the creation of the Center for Global Women’s Health and Gender Equity, focused on researching solutions to mitigate gender health disparities. Further, Hopkins has made substantial progress in sports, a historically male dominated field, now boasting 10 women’s teams — notably, the Division I women’s lacrosse team. In 2022, Hopkins Athletics celebrated 50 successful years of women's sports, including ten national championships. When Hopkins first

The new Center for Global Women’s Health and Gender Equity (GWHGE) — directed by Dr. Michele Decker, ScD, MPH at the School of Public Health’s Department of Population, Family and Reproductive Health — aims to mitigate existing gender inequities. The center is guided by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number five and targets multiple issues, from lack of equal representation of all global health communities in leadership and policymaking to mitigating the impacts of gender-based violence through evidence-based research methods. Achieving the gender equality ambitions of the United Nations’ SDGs requires evidence-based systems to measure gender equity data and implement policies that transform or mitigate existing gender inequities. However, funding has not matched the global interest in this effort. Financing for the collection and measurement of gender data decreased by 55% in 2020, an amount that was triple the drop in funding for overall data and statistics across

Many of us woke up last Tuesday to the heartbreaking news that Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge had collapsed. The bridge was struck by the Dali, a Singaporean-flagged cargo ship en route to Sri Lanka. Of the eight people who were on the bridge at the time of its collapse, two were rescued, the bodies of two were recovered and four others are presumed dead. Baltimore is mourning the lives of Miguel Luna, Dorlian Castillo Cabrera, Maynor Yassir Suazo Sandoval, Jose Mynor Lopez, Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes and Carlos (full name not yet released), who were part of a construction crew filling potholes on the bridge. The News-Letter sends our deepest condolences to their families for this devastating loss. The six workers were immigrants from Latin America.

With the legendary impact left behind by jazz singer Billie Holiday, it is only fitting that her native city continues to uphold her legacy and celebrate her music. In honor of Holiday, the University’s Billie Holiday Project for Liberation Arts (BHPLA) hosted its third annual “Jazz in the Square” event on Sept. 11. The concert, held at Lafayette Square Park, featured The Nasar Abadey Quartet and Grammy-nominated artist Maimouna Youssef, better known by her stage name Mumu Fresh. Other Baltimore-based jazz musicians, including students from the Peabody Institute, also performed during the event. Lawrence Jackson, director of BHPLA, emphasized the significance of the event in an interview with The News-Letter. “We want to recover and pay homage to what we call America’s native classical music, jazz music,” Jackson said. “Baltimore is one of the premier sites for the creation of jazz music and we want to make sure that we’re

 Baltimore Transit Equity Coalition aims for completion of Red Line - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By SHIRLENE JOHN                                                     | October 21, 2021
As the nation’s first city to enforce racially determined land covenants in real estate and to codify redlining, residential segregation in Baltimore has deep roots. Though racial segregation has been outlawed, its effects can still be seen to this day. The Baltimore Transit Equity Coalition (BTEC) believes the Red Line light rail initiative could help end the persisting segregation in Baltimore. The Red Line was originally conceptualized in the 1960s as an east-west mass transit light rail system to connect West Baltimore communities, Fells Point, Canton and the Bayview Medical Center. In June 2015, Governor Larry Hogan announced that his administration would not move forward with the project. He redirected funding intended for the Red Line to roads and the Purple Line in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. The cancellation of the Red Line was briefly investigated by the U.S. Department of Transportation after the NAACP filed a complaint arguing

 Who benefits from the new Purple Line rail? - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter

The Maryland Department of Transportation began construction on the Purple Line on August 28 after over two decades of planning. The Purple Line is a 16-mile light rail with 21 stops between Montgomery County and Prince George’s County of Maryland. Development of the Purple Line project began in 2002, but concerns over its $2 billion cost and construction have delayed the process. Though many have welcomed new transportation services that would help ease daily commutes, others criticized MD Governor Larry Hogan’s decision to support the Purple Line while cancelling the construction of Red Line, a proposed light rail that would have served predominantly African-American low income neighborhoods in Baltimore. In 2015, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Legal Defense and Education Fund filed a complaint alleging that the decision to cancel Red Line discriminated against African-Americans. According to the NAACP, the Red Line could have alleviated

President Joe Biden answered questions delivered by CNN anchor Anderson Cooper at a CNN town hall meeting in Baltimore on Oct. 21. The event took place at Baltimore Center Stage in Mount Vernon. Many Baltimore residents attended the event and asked Biden questions regarding child care, climate change, gas prices and supply chain management. The event was invitation-only. Students and faculty from several universities in Baltimore attended, including Hopkins, Morgan State University and Loyola University. Biden spoke about his plans for the care economy and infrastructure and discussed how these agendas will be funded, claiming taxes will not be raised. At the event, Biden noted that he proposed free child care for households making under $300,000 a year and training more home health-care workers for the elderly under his economic plan. "We have two plans. One is the infrastructure plans, roads, highways, bridges, buses, trains, et cetera, and the other

 22 Hopkins things to do before you graduate from ‘22 grads - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By HANNA SUH                                                                                      and                                 ADYANT BALAJI                                                                                 | May 22, 2022
While this list compiles a few events and activities that (as the title suggests) must be experienced during your time at Hopkins, it is most enjoyable when they are done completely by accident. We encourage you to spontaneously do random things as well and create your own list. If you find yourself wandering through campus and hear commotion and noise from Arellano Theater, approach it. And always say yes to free food — you’ll find yourself staying for the event. Having said that, here is a bucket list of 22 things to do as Blue Jays from the Class of ‘22: Making custom buttons at the Digital Media Center. Just using the button press and making pins checks so many boxes for taking a break from work. Satisfying? Check. Head empty? Check. Cute? Check. Looking at the stars at the Bloomberg Observatory. Open every Friday evening, the Maryland Space Grant

 A year of bike rides through Baltimore - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By NEHA SANGANA                                                     | May 22, 2022
I think it’s fair to say that everyone lost their minds during quarantine in different ways and dealt with it in different ways. Me? You guessed it — I developed an addiction to lazy bike rides in the Texas sun through my suburban neighborhood. I’m from Austin, Texas. It’s a nice city. People are currently moving there in hordes because of how nice it is. Predictably, it’s a nice city to bike through, and it was nice enough that I spent all my junior year there. Fast forward to August 2021: my senior year at Hopkins. My final year in Baltimore. I bought a bike at Walmart for $100. My father expressed many concerns about safety as he helped me transfer it from his rented SUV to my apartment’s bike room. After he left that day, I worked up the courage to painstakingly wheel it out of my apartment building.

 Favorite places in Baltimore from '22 grads - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By ALINA PANNONE                                                     | May 22, 2022
For many of us, Baltimore might not have been the first city that came to mind when we envisioned our college life. But after spending four years here, I've grown to appreciate the city and its hidden gems. So, without further ado, here is a list of places in Baltimore that have become favorites for my friends and I: "It is hard to pick a favorite, but I've had many fond memories at the [C.] Grimaldis Gallery. I accidentally stumbled upon this gallery after not being able to get into a Peabody concert. I ended up meeting Raoul Middleman, who was present at the opening night of his show. As a Hopkins alum, he was as excited to meet us as we were to meet him! It was a surreal experience, and since then, I've always went back and looked forward to meeting more artists and learning about their works”

 Memories with my roommate, best friend, sister - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By ROMILA SANTRA                                                     | May 22, 2022
I’ll be honest: I don’t know how to do the graduation thing. It’s not the wear-a-cap-and-gown, walk-across-the-stage part that perplexes me. It’s more the aftermath: the friends-leaving-forever part. Of course, we’ve all done it before. I still remember the goodbyes during the summer after my high school graduation. My friends and I gathered the evening before the first of us departed, letting it sink in that a phase of our lives was truly complete. At the time it felt momentous. Those were friends I’d known for the better part of a decade. Why, then, does it feel somewhat more devastating to depart from people I’ve known for less than four years? I know, at least, part of the answer. In high school, we all hung out at school or in each other’s houses. In college, we shared not just classrooms but also homes. With our families suddenly hundreds of miles

 Saying goodbye to The News-Letter - The Johns Hopkins News-Letter
By REBECCA MURATORE                                                     | May 22, 2022
Like many freshmen, when I first got to Hopkins I had no idea what I was going to do with my time here. Pacing through the aisles at my first Student Involvement Fair (SIF) and putting my name down for any club that sounded vaguely interesting, I cast a net as wide as I could. Most of those frantic, overeager freshman sign-ups amounted to little more than receiving monthly emails from clubs I never ended up attending. The News-Letter, however, sent the one club email I actually paid attention to. Still clinging onto my days as a copy editor for my high school newspaper, I started going once a week to The News-Letter’s office — the Gatehouse — to help edit articles as a copy reader. Back in that pre-COVID world, The News-Letter produced a newspaper in print every Thursday, which meant Wednesday nights were when pretty much the whole
